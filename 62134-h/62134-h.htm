  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> stepping out of the fifteenth into the sixteenth century one becomes
    conscious of a change; no such change was felt in passing from the
    twelfth to the thirteenth century, or from the fourteenth to the
    fifteenth. The world of Henry the Sixth was the same world as that of
    Edward the First; it was also the same as that of Henry the Second.
    For four hundred years no sudden, perceptible, or radical change took
    place either in manners and customs, language, arts, or ideas. There
    had, of course, been outbreaks; there had been passionate longings for
    change; men before their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> time, like Wyclyf, had advanced new ideas
    which sprang up like grass and presently withered away; there had
    been changes in religious thought, but there was no change, so far,
    in religious institutions. At the beginning of the sixteenth century,
    however, we who know the coming events can see the change impending,
    change already begun. Whether the Bishops and Clergy, the Monks and
    Friars, were also conscious of impending change, I know not. It seems
    as if they must have been uneasy, as in France men were uneasy long
    before the Revolution. On the other hand, Rome still loomed large
    in the imagination of the world: the Rock on which the Church was
    established; the Throne from which there was no appeal; the hand that
    held the Keys. We have now, however, to chronicle the part, the large
    part, played by London in this great century of Revolution.</p>

  <p>After forty years of Civil War,—with murders, exactions, executions,
    treacheries, and perjuries innumerable, with the ruin of trade, with
    the extinction of ancient families, with the loss of all the French
    conquests,—the City, no less than the country at large, welcomed the
    accession of a Prince who promised order and tranquillity at least. Of
    all the numerous descendants of Edward the Third who might once have
    called themselves heirs to the Crown before the Duke of Richmond, there
    remained but two or three. Of the Lancastrians Henry alone was left,
    and his title was derived from a branch legitimised. The two brothers
    of Henry V. had no children; the only son of Henry VI. was dead. On
    the Yorkist side Edward’s two sons were dead; Richard’s only son was
    dead; there remained the young Earl of Warwick, son of Clarence.
    He was the one dangerous person at the time of Henry’s accession.
    Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, was not the heir to the Yorkist
    claims—this was certainly the eldest daughter of Edward the Fourth;
    but he was the son of George, Duke of Clarence, and the last male
    descendant of the York line. He was now fifteen years of age, and had
    been kept in some kind of confinement at a place called Sheriff Hutton
    Castle, in the County of York. Considering the practice of the time,
    and the reputation of Richard III., one wonders at his forbearance
    in not murdering the boy. Henry sent him—it was his first act after
    his victory—to the Tower for better safety. Grafton<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> calls this
    unfortunate Prince “the yongling borne to perpetual captivitie.” He is
    said to have been a simple youth, wholly ignorant of the world. Though,
    as we shall see later on, Henry found it expedient to treat this young
    Prince after the manner of his time. A dead Prince can never become a
    Pretender.</p>

  <p>And no other fate was possible in the long-run for one whom
    conspirators might put up at any moment as the rightful claimant of the
    Crown. The unfortunate youth was only one of a long chain of possible
    claimants, all of whom paid the penalty of their inheritance by death.
    Among them were Edward’s infant Princes; his own <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>father; Henry’s son,
    Edward, Prince of Wales; and later on Lady Jane Grey, and Mary Queen of
    Scots.</p>

  <p>In the same castle of Sheriff Hutton, in similar confinement, was
    the Lady Elizabeth, Edward the Fourth’s elder daughter, whom Richard
    proposed to marry with the sanction of the Pope, his own wife, Anne,
    having strangely and mysteriously come to her death. Bosworth Field put
    a stop to that monstrous design. According to Grafton, the purpose of
    Richard was well known to the world, and was everywhere detested and
    condemned.</p>

  <p>Henry rode to London immediately after his victory. At Shoreditch
    he was received by the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen, clothed in
    violet and bearing a gift of a thousand marks. He then went on to
    St. Paul’s and there deposited three standards—on one was the image
    of St. George, on another a “red fierie dragon beaten upon white and
    greene sarcenet,” and on the third was painted “a dun cow upon yellow
    <i>tarterne</i>.” He also heard a Te Deum.</p>

  <p>Four weeks after Henry’s entrance into the City there broke out, quite
    suddenly, with no previous warning, a most deadly pestilence known as
    the sweating sickness. This dreadful epidemic began with a “burning
    sweat that invaded the body and vexed the blood, and with a most ardent
    heat infested the stomach and the head grievously.” If any person could
    bear the heat and pain for twenty-four hours, he recovered, but might
    have a relapse; not one in a hundred, however, of those that took the
    infection survived. Within a few days it killed two Mayors, namely, Sir
    Thomas Hill and Sir William Stocker; and six Aldermen. The sickness
    seems to have been swifter, and more deadly while it lasted, than even
    the Plague or the Epidemic of 1349. But it went away after a time as
    quickly as it had appeared.</p>

  <p>Henry’s coronation was celebrated on the 13th of October. His
    predecessor had disguised the weakness of his title by the splendour
    of his coronation. Henry, on the other hand, made but a mean
    display—perhaps to show that he was not dependent on show or
    magnificence. Stanley perceives in this absence of ostentation a kind
    of acknowledgment that his title to the Crown rested more upon his
    victory than his descent. This opinion seems to me wholly fanciful;
    Henry would never at any moment acknowledge that his title was weak.
    On the other hand, he stoutly claimed, through his mother, to be the
    nearest heir in the Lancastrian line. His known dislike to ostentation
    is quite a sufficient reason to account for the comparative poverty of
    the Coronation show—at which, however, one new feature was introduced,
    namely, the bodyguard of the King’s person, known as the Yeomen of the
    Guard. The King’s belief in the strength of his own title was shown in
    his treatment of the Lady Elizabeth. He had solemnly promised to marry
    her; he did so in January 1486, five months after his victory; but he
    was extremely loth to crown her, lest some should say that the Queen
    was Queen by right, and not merely the Queen consort. The coronation of
    the Queen was postponed for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> years. The celebration, however, when
    it did take place, was accompanied by a great deal of splendour.</p>

  <p>The business of Lambert Simnel shows the real peril of the King’s
    position. The experience of the last forty years had taught the people
    a most dangerous habit. They were ready to fly to arms on the smallest
    provocation. Who was Henry, “the unknown Welshman,” as Richard called
    him, that he should be allowed to sit in peace upon a throne from
    which three occupants had been dragged down, two by murder and one by
    battle? But the occasion of the rising was ridiculous. The young Earl
    of Warwick was in the Tower; it was possible to see him—Henry, in
    fact, made him ride through the City for all the world to see. Yet the
    followers of Lambert Simnel proclaimed that he was Edward Plantagenet,
    Earl of Warwick. Lambert’s father was a joiner of Oxford; Sir Richard
    Symon, a priest, was his tutor. The boy, who in 1486 was about eleven
    years of age, was of handsome appearance and of naturally good manners.</p>

  <p>After the defeat of his cause, Lambert and the priest who had done the
    mischief were taken. The priest was consigned to an ecclesiastical
    prison for the rest of his natural life; the boy was pardoned—they
    could not execute a child—and contemptuously thrust into the King’s
    kitchen as a little scullion. He afterwards rose to be one of the
    King’s falconers—the only example in history of a Pretender turning
    out an honest man in the end. Can we not see the people about the
    Court gazing curiously upon the handsome scullion in his white jacket,
    white cap, and white shoes, going to and fro upon his duties, washing
    pans with zeal and scraping trenchers? The boy had a lovely face, and
    manners very far beyond his station. Can we not hear them whispering
    that this young man had once been as good as King, and knew what it was
    to exercise royal authority?</p>

  <p>The Earl of Warwick was still, however, allowed to live.</p>

  <p>The King, who was magnanimous when it was politic, could also exhibit
    the opposite quality on occasion. He had never found it easy to forgive
    Edward’s Queen for submitting herself and her daughters to Richard
    after she had consented to Henry’s attempt upon the Crown, on the
    condition of his marrying the eldest. He laid the matter before his
    Council, who determined that Elizabeth, late Queen, should forfeit all
    her lands and possessions, and should continue for the rest of her life
    in honourable confinement in the Abbey of Bermondsey. Here, in fact,
    she died, not long afterwards, the second Queen who breathed her last
    in that House.</p>

  <p>One Pretender removed, another arose. Perkin Warbeck professed, as we
    know, to be the younger son of Edward IV., namely, Richard, Duke of
    York, who, it was pretended, had escaped from the Tower. The strange
    adventures of Perkin are told in every history of England. He is
    connected with that of London on three occasions. The first was after
    his abortive attempt to land in Kent. The Kentish men, refusing to join
    him, attacked his followers, drove some of them back to their ships,
    and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> prisoners a hundred and sixty men with four Captains. These
    prisoners were all brought to London roped together, a curious sight
    to see. Those who lived on London Bridge saw many strange sights, but
    seldom anything more strange than these poor prisoners, who were not
    Englishmen but aliens, thus tied together. They were all hanged, every
    one: some on the seashore, where their bodies might warn other aliens
    not to come filibustering into England; and the rest at Tyburn.</p>

    <div class="caption">PERKIN WARBECK (1474–1499)<br />
      From a drawing in the Municipal Library, Arras.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Cornish Rebellion was an episode in the history of the Perkin
    Warbeck business. The men of Cornwall refused to pay taxes and resolved
    to march upon London. Led by Lord Audley they advanced through
    Salisbury and Winchester into Kent: they were there opposed, and moved
    towards London, finally lying at Blackheath. The battle that followed
    was chiefly fought at the bridge at Deptford Strand. Two thousand
    of the rebels were killed; fifteen hundred were taken; Lord Audley
    was beheaded; two demagogues who had instigated the rising, namely,
    Flammock an attorney, and Joseph a farrier, were hanged; the rest were
    not pursued or punished.</p>

  <p>The City, meantime, showed its loyalty by a loan of £4000 to the King
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> by putting London into a state of defence. Six Aldermen and a
    number of representatives from the Livery Companies were deputed to
    attend to the City ordnance; houses built close to the wall were taken
    down; the Mayor was allowed an additional twelve men, and the Sheriffs
    forty serjeants and forty valets to keep the peace.</p>

  <p>Among those appointed to guard the City gates was Alderman Fabyan the
    Chronicler.</p>

  <p>The next episode in Perkin’s career which touches London is that ride
    which he undertook, very much against his will, from Westminster to the
    Tower. Everybody knows how he gave himself up to the Prior of Shene.
    The King granted him his life, but he imposed certain conditions. He
    was placed in the stocks opposite the entrance to Westminster Hall,
    where he sat the whole day long, receiving “innumerable reproaches,
    mocks and scornings.” The day after he was carried through London
    on horseback, in sham triumph. They were ingenious in those days in
    their methods of putting offenders to open shame. At an earlier date
    the traitor Turberville had to ride in shameful guise; and when Lord
    Audley, Captain of the Cornish Rebels, was led out to execution, he
    was attired in a paper robe painted with his arms, the robe being
    slashed and torn. No doubt Perkin was handsomely attired in coloured
    paper, with a tinsel crown upon his head; no doubt, too, he bestrode
    a villainous hack, while all the ’prentices of London ran after him,
    laughing and mocking. They placed him on a scaffold by the Standard in
    Chepe and kept him there all day long. In the course of the day he read
    aloud his own confession, which is a very curious document.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“First it is to be knowne, that I was borne in the towne of Turneie
      in Flanders, and my father’s name is John Osbecke, which said
      John Osbecke was controller of the said towne of Turneie, and my
      moother’s name is Katherine de Faro ... againste my will they
      made me to learn Englishe and taught me what I shoulde do or say.
      And after this they called me Duke of Yorke.... And upon this the
      said Water, Stephen Poitron, John Tiler, Hubert Burgh, with manie
      others, as the aforesaid earles, entered into this false quarrell.
      And within short time after the French king sent an ambassador into
      Ireland, whose name was Loit Lucas, and maister Stephen Friham, to
      advertise me to come into France. And thense I went into France,
      and from thense into Flanders, and from Flanders into Ireland, and
      from Ireland into Scotland and so into England.” (Grafton.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The last occasion of his public appearance was on the day when he was
    hanged. After his two days’ enjoyment of pillory he was taken to the
    Tower and was contemptuously told that he would have to end his days
    there in confinement. Here he soon brought an end upon himself. He
    found in the Tower the young Earl of Warwick, who, as we have seen,
    was a very simple young man. Perhaps Perkin understood very well that,
    even if his own pretensions were hopelessly discredited, with the
    real Earl of Warwick, Clarence’s undoubted son, grandson of the great
    Earl, the last male representative of the House of York, there would
    be the chance of a far greater rising than either Simnel’s or his own.
    He was already sick of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> prison; the chances of a rising seemed worth
    taking, with all its perils and dangers; he was probably desperate and
    reckless. He accordingly bribed his keepers with promises to connive at
    the escape of the Earl and himself. One has an instinctive feeling that
    they only pretended to connive; that the course of the plot was daily
    communicated to the Governor of the Tower, and by him to the King;
    that the wretched man was encouraged and urged on in order to give an
    opening for the greatly desired destruction of the Earl as well as his
    own. However that may be, in the end Perkin and a fellow-conspirator,
    one John Atwater, were placed on hurdles and drawn to Tyburn, where
    they received the attentions reserved for traitors. Perkin died, it is
    said, confessing his guilt. Guilty or not guilty, it was a convenient
    way of ridding the King not only of an impudent pretender, but also
    of a dangerous rival. Edward Plantagenet was beheaded on Tower Hill:
    his end is said to have been suggested by the King of Spain before the
    betrothal of Prince Arthur to Katherine of Aragon. It was sixteen years
    after his accession that Henry caused the unlucky youth to be beheaded;
    and now no rival was left to disturb the security of Henry’s crown.</p>

  <p>There was, however, still a third personation, passed over by most
    historians, this time by a native of London. The new Pretender was
    named Ralph Wilford, the son of a shoemaker. He fell into the hands
    of a scoundrel named Patrick, an Augustine friar, who taught him what
    to say and how to say it. The two began to go about the country in
    Kent, and to whisper among the simple country folk the same story that
    Lambert Simnel had told. This lad was none other than the Earl of
    Warwick. When the friar found that the thing was receiving, here and
    there, a little credence, he began to back up the boy, and even went
    into the pulpit and preached on the subject. But this time the matter
    was not allowed to get to a head. There was no rebellion: both the
    rebels were arrested, the young man was hanged at St. Thomas Waterings,
    and the friar was put into prison for the rest of his natural life.</p>

  <p>In the year 1500 was a “great death” in London and in other parts.
    The “great death” was due to an outbreak of plague; not the sweating
    sickness, which also returned later, but apparently some form of the
    old plague, the “Black Death.” It is one of the many visitations which
    fell upon the City, afflicted it for a time, filled the churchyards
    with dead bodies, then passed away and was forgotten. Twenty thousand
    persons, according to Fabyan, were carried off in London alone. The
    King retired to Calais till the worst was over.</p>

  <p>On the 14th November 1501, Prince Arthur, then a little over fifteen
    years of age, was married to Katherine of Aragon, who was then three
    years older. They were married in St. Paul’s Cathedral. Holinshed says
    that a long stage was erected, 6 feet high, leading from the west doors
    to the Choir; that at the end was raised a Mount on which there was
    room for eight persons, with steps to go up and down;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> and that on this
    platform stood the King and Queen and the bridegroom, and on it also
    the Mayor and Aldermen were allowed a place.</p>

    <div class="caption">KATHERINE OF ARAGON AND ARTHUR, PRINCE OF WALES<br />
      C. Butler’s Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>After the ceremony a splendid feast was held, with dancing and
    disguisings. Holinshed concludes his account of the wedding by an
    anecdote which, if true, proves that the Princess was truly the wife of
    Arthur. The day after, the Royal party went to Westminster, where there
    were tournaments and great rejoicings. The Prince died five months
    afterwards. Another royal wedding, held on the 25th January 1502,
    caused even greater rejoicing. It was that of the Princess Margaret
    with the King of Scotland; a marriage which promised peace and goodwill
    between the two nations; a promise which has been fulfilled in a manner
    unexpected, by the failure of the male line of Tudors. One observes
    how strong the desire of Henry VII. was to conciliate the goodwill of
    London. He borrowed money from the City over and over again, but he
    always repaid these loans. The exactions that we find recorded are
    chiefly those of his old age—when he was fifty-two years of age,
    which was old for that time, when he had grown covetous. He could be
    ostentatious when show was wanted, witness the marriage of Prince
    Arthur with Katherine. He could also entertain with regal splendour,
    witness the Christmas cheer he offered to the Mayor and Aldermen.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Henry VII., in the ninth Year of his Reign, holding his Feast
      of Christmas at Westminster, on the twelfth Day, feasted Ralph
      Anstry, then Mayor of London, and his Brethren the Aldermen, with
      other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> Commoners in great number; and, after Dinner, dubbing the
      Mayor Knight, caused him with his Brethren to stay and behold the
      Disguisings and other Disports in the Night following, shewed in
      the great Hall, which was richly hanged with Arras, and staged
      about on both sides; which Disports being ended, in the Morning,
      the King, the Queen, the Embassadors, and other Estates, being set
      at a Table of Stone, sixty knights and esquires served sixty Dishes
      to the King’s Mess, and as many to the Queen’s (neither Flesh nor
      Fish), and served the Mayor with twenty-four Dishes to his Mess,
      of the same manner, with sundry Wines in most plenteous wise. And,
      finally, the King and Queen being conveyed, with great Lights, into
      the Palace, the Mayor, with his Company, in Barges, returned and
      came to London by Break of the next day.” (Maitland, vol. i. p.
      218.)</p>

    <div class="caption">THE EXCHEQUER IN THE TIME OF HENRY VII.<br />
      From a print in the British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Henry VII. was respected and feared, rather than loved. He kept his
    word; if he borrowed he paid back; he was not savage or murderous; and
    he was a great lover of the fine arts. But the chief glory of his reign
    is that he enforced order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> throughout the realm: it is his chief glory,
    because order is a most difficult thing to enforce at a time when the
    people have been flying to arms on every possible occasion for forty
    years. In the rising of Lambert Simnel; in that of Perkin Warbeck; in
    the strange determination of the Cornishmen to march upon London,—one
    can see the natural result of a long civil war. Men become, very
    easily, ready to refer everything to the arbitration of battle; in
    such arbitration anything may happen. It was such arbitration that set
    Edward up and pulled Henry down, and then reversed the arrangement. It
    was such arbitration that placed the crown on Henry Tudor’s head. Why
    should not young Perkin step into a throne as Richard, Duke of York?
    Henry accepted the arbitrament of battle, defeated his rival, and
    dispersed the rebel armies one after the other. One would think that
    the spirit of rebellion would be quickly daunted by so many reverses.
    It was not so; for nearly a hundred years later there were rebellions.
    They broke out again and again: the people could not lose that trick of
    flying to arms; the barons could not understand that their power was
    gone; the memory still survived of princes dragged down, and princes
    set up, as Fortune turned the way of Victory.</p>

  <p>Henry, like all the Tudors, was arbitrary: he had no intention of being
    ruled by the City; by his agents Empson and Dudley he levied fines
    right and left upon the wealthier merchants; he put the Mayor and the
    Sheriffs in the Marshalsea on a trumped-up charge, and they had to pay
    a fine of £1400 before he would let them out. He seized Christopher
    Hawes, Alderman, and put him also in prison, but the poor man died of
    terror and grief. He imprisoned William Capel, Alderman, who refused
    to pay a fine of £2000 for his liberty, and remained in prison till
    the King died. Lawrence Aylmer, ex-Mayor, was also imprisoned in the
    Compter, where he remained till the King’s death. Henry understood very
    clearly that with a full Treasury many things are possible that are
    impossible with empty coffers. He accumulated, therefore, a tremendous
    hoard: it is said to have amounted to one million eight hundred
    thousand pounds in money, plate, and jewels.</p>

  <p>The events which belong especially to London in this reign, as we
    have seen, were not numerous, nor were they of enduring importance.
    As regards building, the King pulled down a chapel and a house—the
    house where Chaucer once lived—at the west end of Westminster Abbey,
    and built the Chapel called after his name; the Cross of Westchepe
    was finished and put up; Baynard’s Castle was rebuilt, “not after the
    former manner with embellishments and Towers,” but more convenient. It
    was the time when the castle was passing into the country house; it
    became now a large and handsome palace, built round two courts facing
    the river, much like those palaces built along the Strand, but without
    any garden except the courts.</p>

  <p>The City showed more than its usual jealousy of strangers when in
    1486 it passed an Ordinance that “no apprentice should be taken nor
    Freedom given, but to such as were gentlemen born, agreeable to the
    clause in the oath given to every <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>Freeman at the time he was made
    Free.”... “You shall take no Apprentice but if he be free born.”
    These are Maitland’s words. The statement is surely absurd. For
    suppose such a regulation to hold good for the wholesale distributing
    Companies, how could it be sustained in the case of the Craft
    Companies? Did a gentleman’s son ever become a working blacksmith or
    a journeyman saddler? Another kind of jealousy was shown by the City
    when they passed an Act which prohibited any citizen under penalty
    of £100 (one-third to be given the Informer) for taking any goods or
    merchandise to any Fair or Market within the Kingdom, for the term of
    seven years. What did it mean? That the country merchants should come
    to London for their wares? Parliament set aside this Regulation the
    following year.</p>

  <p>A sanitary edict was passed to the effect that no animals should be
    killed within the City. There is no information as to the length of
    time that this edict was obeyed, if it were ever obeyed at all.</p>

  <p>In 1503 the King showed his opinion of the authority of the City
    when he granted a Charter to the Company of Merchant Taylors which
    practically placed them outside the jurisdiction of the Mayor. Some of
    the other Companies, perceiving that, if this new independence were
    granted everywhere, there would be an end of the City, joined in a
    petition to Parliament for placing them formally under the authority of
    the Mayor and Aldermen. The City got a Charter from the King in 1505.
    The Charter, which cost 5000 marks, was especially levelled against
    recent encroachments of foreigners in buying and selling, and was drawn
    up to the same effect, and partly in the same words, as the Fifth and
    last Charter of King Edward the Third. Thus the conclusion of Edward’s
    Charter was as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We ... have granted to the said Mayor, etc., that no strangers
      shall from henceforth sell any Wares in the same City or Suburbs
      thereof by Retail, nor shall keep any House, nor be any Broker in
      the said City or Suburbs thereof, saving always the merchants of
      High Almaine, etc.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Henry’s Charter was as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That of all Time, of which the Memory of Man is not to the
      contrary, for the Commonweal of the Realm and City aforesaid,
      it hath been used, and by Authority of Parliament approved and
      confirmed, that no Stranger from the Liberty of the City may buy or
      sell, from any Stranger from the Liberties of the same City, any
      Merchandize or Wares within the Liberties of the same City, upon
      Forfeiture of the same.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A curious story of this reign relates how the King, to use a homely
    proverb, cut off his nose to spite his face. For the conduct of
    Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, in acknowledging the Pretender, so
    incensed him against the Flemings that he banished them all. No
    doubt he inflicted hardship upon the Flemings, but he also—which
    he had not intended—deprived the Merchant Adventurers of London
    of their principal trade. The Hanseatic Merchants, perceiving the
    possible advantage to themselves, imported vast quantities of Flemish
    produce. Then the ’prentices rose and broke into the <i>Gildhalla
      Teutonicorum</i>—the Steelyard—pillaging the rooms and warehouses. There
    was a free fight in Thames Street, and after a time the rioters were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    dispersed. Some were taken prisoners and a few hanged. As nothing more
    is said about the Flemings, one supposes that they all came back again.</p>

  <p>There had been grave complaints about the perjuries of Juries in the
    City. The Jurymen took bribes to favour one cause or the other. It was
    therefore enacted:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That, for the future, no Person or Persons be impannelled or sworn
      into any jury or Inquest in any of the City Courts, unless he be
      worth forty Marks; and if the Cause to be tried amount to that Sum,
      then no Person shall be admitted as a Juror worth less than one
      hundred Marks; and every Person so qualified, refusing to serve
      as a Juryman, for the first Default to forfeit one Shilling, the
      second two, and every one after to double the Sum, for the Use of
      the City.”</p>

    <p>“And when upon Trial it shall be found, that a Petty Jury have
      brought in an unjust Verdict, then every Member of the same to
      Forfeit twenty pounds, or more, according to the Discretion of the
      Court of Lord-Mayor and Aldermen; and also each Person so offending
      to suffer six Months’ imprisonment, or less, at the Discretion of
      the said Mayor and Aldermen, without Bail or Mainprize, and for
      ever after to be rendered incapable of serving in any jury.”</p>

    <p>“And if upon Enquiry it be found, that any Juror has taken Money as
      a Bribe, or other Reward, or Promise of Reward, to favour either
      Plaintiff or Defendant in the Cause to be tried by him then, and
      in every such case, the Person so offending to forfeit and pay to
      the Party by him thus injured ten times the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> Value of such Sum or
      Reward by him taken, and also to suffer imprisonment as already
      mentioned, and besides, to be disabled from ever serving in that
      Capacity; and that every Person or Persons guilty of bribing any
      Juror, shall likewise forfeit ten times the value given, and suffer
      imprisonment as aforesaid.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 219.)</p>

  <p>Fortifications commanding roads and approaches to the City were erected
    in the year 1496, especially on the south side, in order to defend the
    City against the Cornish rebels. It is quite possible that some of
    them remained, and that some of the supposed works of 1642 were only a
    restoration or a rebuilding of forts and bastions on the same places.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>In the year 1498 many gardens in Finsbury Fields were thrown into a
    spacious Field for the use of the London Archers or Trained bands. This
    field is now the Artillery Ground with Bunhill Fields Cemetery. In 1501
    the Lord Mayor erected Kitchens and Offices in the Guildhall, by means
    of which he entertained the Aldermen and the principal citizens.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of his reign, the King, finding himself afflicted with
    an incurable disease, took steps in the nature of atonement for his
    sins. He issued a general pardon to all men for offences committed
    against his laws—thieves, murderers, and certain others excepted. He
    paid the fees of prisoners who were kept in gaol for want of money to
    discharge their fees; he also paid the debts of all those who were
    confined in the “counters” of Ludgate, <i>i.e.</i> the free men of the City,
    for sums of forty shillings and under; and some he relieved that were
    confined for as much as ten pounds. “Hereupon,” says Holinshed, “there
    were processions daily in every City and parish to pray to Almighty God
    for his restoring to health and long continuance in the same.” But in
    vain; for the disease continued and the King died.</p>

  <p>Here is a note on the first visit of Henry the Eighth to the City:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Prince Henry, who afterwards succeeded his father on the throne
      as King Henry VIII., but was at the time a child of seven years,
      paid a visit to the City (30 Oct. 1498), where he received a hearty
      welcome, and was presented by the Recorder, on behalf of the
      citizens, with a pair of gilt goblets. In reply to the Recorder,
      who in presenting this ‘litell and powre’ gift, promised to
      remember his grace with a better at some future time, the prince
      made the following short speech:—</p>

    <p>‘Fader Maire, I thank you and your Brethren here present of this
      greate and kynd remembraunce which I trist in tyme comyng to
      deserve. And for asmoche as I can not give unto you according
      thankes, I shall pray the Kynges Grace to thank you, and for my
      partye I shall not forget yor kyndnesse.’” (Sharpe, <i>London and the
        Kingdom</i>, vol. i. p. 334.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The funeral of the King was most sumptuous.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“His corpse was conveyed from Richmond to St. Paul’s on the 9th
      May, being met on its way at St. George’s Bar, in Southwark,
      by the mayor, aldermen, and a suite of 104 commoners, all in
      black clothing and all on horseback. The streets were lined with
      other members of the companies bearing torches, the lowest craft
      occupying the first place. Next after the freemen of the city came
      the ‘strangers’—Easterlings, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Venetians,
      Genoese, Florentines and ‘Lukeners’—on horseback and on foot,
      also bearing torches. These took up their position in Gracechurch
      Street. Cornhill was occupied by the lower crafts, ordered in such
      a way that ‘the most worshipful crafts’ stood next unto ‘Paules.’
      A similar order was preserved the next day, when the corpse was
      removed from Saint Paul’s to Westminster. The lowest crafts were
      placed nearest to the Cathedral, and the most worshipful next
      to Temple Bar, where the civic escort terminated. The mayor and
      aldermen proceeded to Westminster by water, to attend the ‘masse
      and offering.’ The mayor, with his mace in his hand, made his
      offering next after the Lord Chamberlain; those aldermen who had
      passed the chair offered next after the Knights of the Garter, and
      before all ‘knights for the body’; whilst the aldermen who had
      not yet served as mayor made their offering after the knights.”

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">London</span> has now changed its character: the old quarrels and rivalries of
    Baron, Alderman, or Lord of the Manor with merchant, of merchant with
    craftsman, of master with servant, have ceased. The Lord of the Manor
    has disappeared in the City; the craft companies have at last gained
    their share in the government of the City, but, so far to their own
    advantage, they are entirely ruled by the employers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> masters who
    belong to them, so that the craftsmen themselves are no better off than
    before. The authority of the King over the City is greater now than
    at any preceding time, but it will be restrained in the future not so
    much by charters, by bribes and gifts, as by the power of the Commons.
    The trade of the City, which had so grievously suffered by the Civil
    wars, is reviving again under the peace and order of the Tudor Princes,
    though it will be once more injured by the religious dissensions.
    Lastly, the City, like the rest of the country, is already feeling the
    restlessness that belongs to a period of change. At Henry’s accession,
    men were beginning to be conscious of a larger world: wider thoughts
    possessed them; the old learning, the old Arts, were rising again from
    the grave; the crystallised institutions, hitherto fondly thought to
    be an essential part of religion, were ready to be broken up. Even the
    most narrow City merchant, whose heart was in his money-bags, whose
    soul was to be saved by a trental of masses, an anniversary, or a
    chantry, felt the uneasiness of the time, and yearned for a simpler
    Faith as well as for wider markets across the newly-traversed seas.
    I propose to consider the events of this reign, which were of such
    vast importance to London as well as the country at large, by subjects
    instead of in chronological order as hitherto.</p>

  </div>

  <p>And I will first take the relations of the City and the King.</p>

  <p>They began with a manifest desire of the young King to conciliate
    the City. Evidently in answer to some petition or representation, he
    banished all “foreign” beggars, <i>i.e.</i> those who were not natives of
    London; and ordered them to return to their own parishes. It is easy
    to understand what happened: the “foreign” beggars, in obedience to
    the proclamation, retired to their holes and corners; the streets were
    free from them for some days; the Mayor and Sheriffs congratulated
    themselves; then after a decent interval, and gradually, the beggars
    ventured out again. The difficulty, in a word, of dealing with rogues
    and vagrants and masterless men was already overwhelming. In the time
    of Elizabeth it became a real, a threatening, danger to the town. We
    must remember that one effect of a long war, especially a civil war,
    which calls out a much larger proportion of the people than a foreign
    war, is to throw upon the roads, at the close of it, a vast number of
    those who have tasted the joys of idleness and henceforth will not
    work. They would rather be flogged and hanged than work. They cannot
    work. They have forgotten how to work. They rob on the high road; they
    murder in the remote farm-houses; in the winter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> and when they grow
    old, they make for the towns, and they beg in the streets. However,
    Henry greatly pleased the City by his order, and for a time there was
    improvement. He then took a much more important step towards winning
    the affection of the City. He committed Empson and Dudley to the Tower.
    They were accused of a conspiracy against the Government—in reality
    they had been the approved agents of the late King; but this it would
    have been inconvenient to confess. They were therefore found guilty
    and executed—these unfortunately too willing tools of a rapacious
    sovereign. Henry offered restitution to all who had suffered at their
    hands. It was found on subsequent inquiry that six men, all of whom had
    been struck off the lists for perjury, had managed to get replaced, and
    had been busy at work for Empson and Dudley in raking up false charges
    against Aldermen or in taking bribes for concealing offences. These
    persons, as being servants and not principals, were treated leniently.
    They were set in pillory, and then driven out of the City.</p>

  <p>The loyalty of the City showed itself on the day of the Coronation when
    the King, with his newly married Queen, rode in magnificent procession
    from the Tower to Westminster, where the Crowning was performed with a
    splendour which surpassed that of all previous occasions.</p>

  <p>On St. John’s Eve 1510 the King, disguised as one of his own yeomen,
    went into the City in order to witness the finest show of the year, the
    procession of the City Watch. He was so well pleased with the sight
    that on St. Peter’s Eve following he brought his Queen and Court to
    Cheapside to see the procession again:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The March was begun by the City musick, followed by the
      Lord-Mayor’s officers in Party-coloured Liveries; then the
      Sword-Bearer on Horseback, in beautiful Armour, preceded the
      Lord-Mayor, mounted on a stately Horse richly trapped, attended
      by a Giant, and two Pages on Horseback, three Pageants,
      Morrice-dancers, and Footmen; next came the Sheriffs, preceded by
      their Officers, and attended by their Giants, Pages, Pageants,
      and Morrice-Dancers. Then marched a great body of Demi-Lancers,
      in bright Armour, on stately Horses; next followed a Body of
      Carabineers, in white Fustian Coats, with a symbol of the City Arms
      on their Backs and Breasts; then marched a Division of Archers,
      with their Bows bent, and Shafts of Arrows by their Side; next
      followed a Party of Pikemen in their Corslets and Helmets; after
      them a Body of Halberdeers in Corslets and Helmets; and the March
      was closed by a great Party of Billmen, with Helmets and Aprons of
      Mail; and the whole Body, consisting of about two thousand Men,
      had between every Division a certain Number of Musicians, who were
      answered in their proper Places by the like Number of Drums, with
      Standards and Ensigns as veteran troops. This nocturnal March was
      illuminated by Nine hundred and forty Cressets; two hundred whereof
      were defrayed at the City Expence, five hundred at that of the
      Companies, and two hundred and forty by the City Constables. The
      March began at the Conduit at the west end of Cheapside, and passed
      through Cheapside, Cornhill, and Leadenhall Street, to Aldgate;
      whence it returned by Fenchurch Street, Gracechurch Street,
      Cornhill, and so back to the Conduit. During this March, the Houses
      on each side the said streets were decorated with Greens and
      Flowers, wrought into Garlands, and intermixed with a great number
      of Lamps.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 222.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is no more pleasant page in the whole of history than that which
    relates the first years of King Henry’s reign. He was young; he was
    strong; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> married to a woman whom he loved; he was tall, like
    his grandfather King Edward, and of goodly countenance, like his
    grandmother Elizabeth Woodville; he was a lover of arts, like his
    father; and of learning, like his grandmother Margaret, Countess of
    Richmond; he was brave, like all his race; he was masterful, as became
    a king as well as a Tudor; he was skilful in all manly exercises. Add
    to all this that at the time of his accession he was the richest man
    in Europe. This accomplished Prince, according to Holinshed, used,
    even in his progresses, to exercise himself every day in shooting,
    singing, dancing, wrestling, casting the bar, playing on the recorders,
    the flute, the virginals, or writing songs and ballads and setting
    them to music. His songs are principally amorous. He wrote anthems,
    one of which is extant. The words are taken from the Song of Solomon
    (Vulgate). His verse is melodious and pretty:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“O my hart and O my hart</div>

        <div class="i4">And know no cause wherfore.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Or a song of constancy:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Grene grouth the holy, so doth the ivie</div>

    <div class="caption">HENRY VIII. AS A MUSICIAN<br />
      From a Royal MS. in British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>At the outset there was nothing but feasting, jousts, feats of arms,
    masques, devices, pageants, and mummeries. At the feasts the King
    was lavish and free of hand; at the tilting the King challenged all
    and won the prize; at the masques and mummeries he was the best of
    all the actors; at the dance he was the most graceful and the most
    unwearied. There are long pages in contemporary history on this festive
    and splendid life at the Court, when as yet all the world was young
    to Henry, and no one had been executed except Empson and Dudley. The
    following extract from Holinshed shows the things in which he gloried,
    and the nature of a Court Pageant:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Then there was a device or a pageant upon wheels brought in, out
      of the which pageant issued out a gentleman richlie apparelled,
      that shewed how in a garden of pleasure there was an arbor of gold
      wherein were lords and ladies, much desirous to shew pastime to
      the queene and ladies, if they might be licenced so to doo; who
      was answered by the queene, how she and all other there were verie
      desirous to see them and their pastime. Then a great cloth of arras
      that did hang before the same pageant was taken away, and the
      pageant brought more neere. It was curiouslie made and pleasant to
      beholde, it was solemne and rich: for every post or piller thereof
      was covered with frised gold, therein were trees of hawthorne,
      eglantine, rosiers, vines, and other pleasant floures of diverse
      colours, with gillofers, and other hearbs, all made of sattin,
      damaske, silver and gold, accordinglie as the naturall trees,
      hearbs, or floures ought to be. In this arbor were six ladies,
      all apparelled in white satin and greene, set and embrodered full
      of H. &amp; K. of Gold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> knit together with laces of gold of damaske,
      and all their garments were replenished with glittering spangels
      gilt over, on their heads are bonets all opened at the foure
      quarters overfrised with flat gold of damaske, and orrellets were
      of rolles, wreathed on lampas doucke holow, so that the gold shewed
      through the lampas doucke: the fassis of their head set full of new
      devised fashions. In this garden also was the king and five with
      him apparelled in garments of purple sattin, all of cuts with H.
      &amp; K. everie edge garnished with frised gold, and everie garment
      full of posies, made of letters of fine gold in bullion as thicke
      as they might be, and everie person had his name in like letters
      of massie gold. The first Cureloial, the second Bon Voloire, the
      third Bon Espoir, the fourth Valiant Desire, the fifth Bon Foy,
      the sixt Amour Loial, their hosen, cape, and coats were full of
      posies, with H. &amp; K. of fine gold in bullion, so that the ground
      could scarse appeere, and yet was in everie void place spangles of
      gold. When time was come, the said pageant was brought foorth into
      presence, and then descended a lord and a ladie by couples, and
      then the minstrels which were disguised also dansed, and the lords
      and ladies dansed, that it was a pleasure to behold. In the meane
      season the pageant was conveyed to the end of the palace, there to
      tarie till the danses were finished, and so to have received the
      lords and ladies againe: but suddenlie the rude people ran to the
      pageant, and rent, tare, and spoiled the pageant so that the lord
      steward nor the head officers could not cause them to absteine,
      except that they should have foughten and drawen blood and so was
      this pageant broken. Then the king with the queene and the ladies
      returned to his chamber, where they had a great banket, and so this
      triumph ended with mirth and gladnes.” (Holinshed, vol. iii. p.
      560.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the proclamation of war against France, the City was ordered to
    furnish a contingent of 300 men fully armed and equipped. There seems
    to have been no difficulty in getting the men. The money for their
    outfit was subscribed by the Companies, who raised £405, and so the men
    were despatched, clad in white with St. George’s Cross and Sword, and a
    rose in front and back.</p>

  <p>In June 1516 Cardinal Wolsey addressed an admonition to the City:
    they must look to the maintenance of order; there was sedition among
    them; the statute of apparel was neglected; vagabonds and masterless
    men made the City their resort—an instructive commentary on the
    King’s ordinances of seven years before. The sedition of which Wolsey
    complained was due to the intense jealousy with which the people of
    London always regarded the immigration of aliens. They were always
    coming in, and the freemen—the old City families—were always dying
    out or going away. In 1500, and again in 1516, orders were issued for
    all freemen to return with their families to the City on pain of losing
    their freedom. Had they, then, already begun the custom of living in
    the suburbs and going into town every morning? The case against the
    foreigners is strongly put by Grafton:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In this season the Genowayes, Frenchmen and other straungers,
      sayd and boasted themselves to be in suche favor with the king and
      hys counsayle, that they set naught by the rulers of the city:
      and the multitude of straungers was so great about London, that
      the poore English artificers could scarce get any lyvyng: and
      most of al the straungers were so prowde, that they disdayned,
      mocked, and oppressed the Englishmen, which was the beginning of
      the grudge. For among all other thinges there was a carpenter in
      London called Wylliamson which boughte two stocke Doves in Chepe,
      and as he was about to pay for them, a Frenchman tooke them out
      of his hande, and sayde they were not meat for a Carpenter: well
      sayde the Englisheman I have bought them, and now payde for them,
      and therefore I will have them; nay sayde the Frenchman I will have
      them for my Lorde the Ambassador, and so for better or worse, the
      Frenchman called the Englishman knave and went away with the stock
      Doves. The straungers came to the French Ambassador, and surmised
      a complaint against the poore Carpenter, and the Ambassador came
      to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> Lord Maior, and sayde so much, that the Carpenter was sent
      to prison: and yet not contented with this so complayned to the
      king’s counsayle, that the king’s commaundement was layde on him.
      And when syr John Baker and other worshipfull persons sued to
      the Ambassador for him, he aunswered by the body of God that the
      Englishe knave should loose his lyfe, for he sayde no Englisheman
      should denie what the Frenchmen requyred, and other aunswere had
      they none. Also a Frenchman that had slayne a man, should abjure
      the realme and had a crosse in his hande, and then sodainely came
      a great sort of Frenchman about him, and one of them sayde to the
      Constable that led him, syr is thys crosse the price to kill an
      Englisheman. The Constable was somewhat astonied and aunswered
      not. Then sayde another Frenchman, on that price we would be
      banished all by the masse, this saiying was noted to be spoken
      spitefully. Howbeit the Frenchmen were not alonly oppressors of the
      Englishemen, for a Lombard called Frances de Bard, entised a man’s
      wyfe in Lombarde Streete to come to his Chamber with her husband’s
      plate, which thing she did. After when her husband knew it, he
      demanded hys wife, but answere was made he should not have her;
      then he demanded his plate, and in like manner answere was made
      that he should neyther have plate nor wife. And when he had sued
      an action against the straunger in the Guyldehall, the stranger
      so faced the Englishman that he faynted in his sute. And then the
      Lombard arrested the poore man for his wyfes boord, while he kept
      her from her husband in his chamber. This mocke was much noted, and
      for these and many other oppressions done by them, there encreased
      such a malice in the Englishmen’s hartes: that at the last it brast
      out.” (Grafton’s <i>Chronicles</i>, vol. ii. p. 289.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He goes on to relate that a certain John Lincoln, a broker, desired a
    priest named Dr. Standish to move the Mayor and Aldermen at his Spital
    sermon on Easter Monday to take part with the Commonalty against the
    aliens. Standish refused. John Lincoln then went to a certain Dr. Bele,
    Canon in St. Mary Spital, and represented the grievous case of the
    people.</p>

  <p>... “lamentably declared to him, how miserably the common artificers
    lyved, and scarce could get any worke to find them, their wives and
    children, for there were such a number of artificers straungers, that
    toke away all their living in manner.”</p>

  <p>Then followed the tumult known as Evil May Day. Dr. Bele preached
    the Spital Sermon of Easter Tuesday. He first read Lincoln’s letter
    representing the condition of the craftsmen thus oppressed by the
    aliens, and then taking for his text the words, “<span lang="la">Caelum caeli Domino
    Terram autem dedit Filiis hominum</span>”—the Heavens to the Lord of Heaven,
    but the Earth hath he given to the Sons of Men—he plainly told the
    people that England was their own, and that Englishmen ought to keep
    their country for themselves, as birds defend their nests. Thus
    encouraged, the people began to assault and molest the foreigners in
    the City. Some of them were sent to Newgate for the offence; but they
    continued. Then there ran about the City a rumour that on May Day
    all the foreigners would be murdered, and many of them, hearing this
    rumour, fled. The rumour reached the King, who ordered Cardinal Wolsey
    to inquire into it. Thereupon the Mayor called together the Council.
    Some were of opinion that a strong watch should be set and kept up
    all night; others thought that it would be better to order every one
    to be indoors from nine in the evening till nine in the morning. Both
    opinions were sent to the Cardinal, who chose the latter. Accordingly
    the order was proclaimed. But it was not obeyed. Some time after nine,
    Alderman Sir John Mundy found a company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> young men in Cheapside
    playing at Bucklers. He ordered them to desist and to go home. One of
    them asked why? For answer the Alderman seized him and ordered him to
    be taken to the Compter. Then the tumult began. The ’prentices raised
    the cry of “Clubs! Clubs!” and flocked together; the man was rescued;
    the people crowded in from every quarter; they marched, a thousand
    strong, to Newgate, where they took out the Lord Mayor’s prisoners, and
    to the Compter, where they did the same; at St. Martin’s they broke
    open doors and windows and “spoiled everything.” And they spent the
    rest of the night in pulling down the houses of foreigners. When they
    grew tired of this sport, they gradually broke up and went home, but on
    the way the Mayor’s men arrested some three hundred of them and sent
    them to the Tower. Another hundred rioters were arrested next day.
    Dr. Bele was also sent to the Tower. Then began the trials. Lincoln
    and some twenty or thirty others were found guilty and sentenced to
    be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Ten pairs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> gallows were set up in
    different parts of the City for their execution. Lincoln, however, was
    the only one who suffered. For the rest a reprieve was granted. Then
    the affair was concluded in a becoming and solemn manner:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Thursday the xxij day of May, the king came into Westminster
      Hall, for whome at the upper ende was set a cloth of estate, and
      the place hanged with arras. With him was the Cardinall, the Dukes
      of Norfolke and Suffolke, the Earles of Shrewsbury, of Essex,
      Wilshire and of Surrey, with manye Lordes and other of the kinges
      Counsale. The Maior and Aldermen, and all the chief of the City,
      were there in their best livery (according as the Cardinall had
      them appoynted) by ix of the clocke. Then the king commaunded that
      all the prisoners should be brought forth. Then came in the poore
      yonglings and olde false knaves bound in ropes all along, one after
      another in their shirtes, and every one a Halter about his necke,
      to the number of foure hundred men and xj women. And when all were
      come before the kinges presence, the Cardinall sore layd to the
      Maior and commonaltie their negligence, and to the prisoners he
      declared that they had deserved death for their offence: then all
      the prisoners together cryed mercy gracious Lorde, mercy. Then the
      Lordes altogether besought his grace of mercy, at whose request
      the king pardoned them all. And then the Cardinall gave unto them
      a good exhortation to the great gladnesse of the heerers. And when
      the generall pardon was pronounced, all the prisoners showted at
      once, and altogether cast up their Halters unto the Hall rooffe, so
      that the king might perceyve they were none of the discretest sort.
      Here is to be noted that dyvers offenders which were not taken,
      heeryng that the king was inclined to mercys, came well apparayled
      to Westminster, and sodainlye stryped them into their shirtes with
      halters, and came in among the prisoners willingly, to be partakers
      of the kinges pardon, by the which doyng, it was well knowen that
      one John Gelson yoman of the Crowne was the first that beganne to
      spoyle, and exhorted other to do the same, and because he fled and
      was not taken, he came in the rope with the other prisoners, and so
      had his pardon. This companie was after called the blacke Wagon.
      Then were all the Galowes within the Citie taken downe, and many a
      good prayer sayde for the king, and the Citizens tooke more heede
      to their servants.” (Grafton’s <i>Chronicles</i>, vol. ii. p. 294.)</p>

  <p>A singular story belongs to the arrival of the French embassy charged
    with negotiating the marriage of the King’s infant daughter and the
    Dauphin. The ambassadors were escorted by a company of their own King’s
    bodyguard and another of the English King’s bodyguard. They were met at
    Blackheath by the Earl of Surrey, richly apparelled, and a hundred and
    sixty gentlemen; four hundred archers followed; they were lodged in the
    merchants’ houses and banqueted at Taylors’ Hall. And then, says the
    historian, “the French hardermen opened their wares and made Taylors’
    Hall like to the paunde of a mart. At this doing many an Englishman
    grudged but it avayled not.” In other words, a lot of French hucksters,
    under cover of the embassy, brought over smuggled goods and sold them
    in the Taylors’ Hall at a lower price than the English makers could
    afford.</p>

  <p>The reception of the Emperor Charles by Henry in this year was as
    royally magnificent as even Henry himself could desire. The procession
    was like others of the same period and may be omitted.</p>

  <p>In 1524 a curious proclamation was made by the Mayor. Evidently papers
    or letters of importance had been lost.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“My lorde the maire streihtly chargith and commaundith on the king
      or soveraigne lordis behalf that if any maner of person or persons
      that have founde a hat with certeyn lettres and other billes and
      writinges therin enclosed, which lettres been directed to our said
      sovereign from the parties of beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> see, let hym or theym
      bryng the said hat, lettres, and writinges unto my saide lorde
      the maire in all the hast possible and they shalbe well rewarded
      for their labour, and that no maner of person kepe the said hat,
      lettres, and writinges nor noon of them after this proclamacioun
      made, uppon payn of deth, and God save the king.” (Sharpe, <i>London
        and the Kingdom</i>, vol. i. p. 373.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  </div>

  <p>Two cases, that of Sir George Monoux and that of Paul Wythypol,
    prove that the City offices were not at this time always regarded as
    desirable. In the former case, Sir George Monoux, Alderman and Draper,
    was elected (1523) Mayor for the second time, and refused to serve.
    He was fined £1000, and it was ordained by the Court of Aldermen that
    any one in future who should refuse to serve as Mayor should be fined
    that amount. In this case Monoux was permitted to retire, probably on
    account of ill-health. The second case, which happened in 1537, was
    that of Paul Wythypol, merchant-taylor. He was a man of some position
    in the City: he had been one of the Commoners sent to confer with
    Wolsey on the “amicable” loan (Sharpe, <i>London and the Kingdom</i>, vol.
    i. p. 377); he attended the Coronation banquet of Anne Boleyn; he was
    afterwards M.P. for the City, 1529–1536. They elected him Alderman
    for Farringdon Within. For some reason he was anxious not to serve;
    rather than pay the fine he got the King to interfere on his behalf.
    Such interference was clearly an infringement of the City liberties;
    the Mayor and Aldermen consulted Wolsey, who advised them to seek an
    interview with the King, then at Greenwich. This they did, and went
    down to Greenwich. When they arrived they were taken into the King’s
    great chamber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> where they waited till evening, when the King received
    them privately. What passed is not known, but in the end Wythypol
    remained out of office for a year afterwards. At the end of that time
    he was again elected Alderman, and was ordered to take office or to
    swear that his property did not amount to £1000. He refused and was
    committed to Newgate, the King no longer offering to help him. Three
    weeks later he appeared before the Court and offered to pay a fine of
    £40 for three years’ exemption from office. The Court refused this
    offer and sent him back to prison. Three months later—Wythypol must
    have been a very stubborn person—he again appeared before the Court,
    and was ordered to take up office at once or else swear that his
    property was not worth £1000. If he did not, he was to be fined in a
    sum to be assessed by the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council. He did
    not take office, and it is therefore tolerably certain that he paid a
    heavy fine.</p>

  <p>In the year 1529 sat the memorable Court presided over by Cardinals
    Campeggio and Wolsey, which was to try the validity of Henry’s marriage
    with his brother’s widow. It was held in the great hall of the
    Dominican Friars. No more important case was ever tried in an English
    Court of Law, nor one which had wider or deeper consequences. Upon this
    case depended the national Faith; the nation’s fidelity to the Pope;
    its continued adhesion to the ecclesiastical order as it had developed
    during fifteen hundred years. This trial belongs to the national
    history.</p>

  <p>In October of that year (1529) the King, enraged by the Legate’s delay
    in the marriage business, deprived Wolsey of the Seals, seized his
    furniture and plate, and ordered him to leave London. In November
    of the same year, at a Parliament held in the Palace of Bridewell,
    a Bill was passed by the Lords disabling the Cardinal from being
    restored to his dignities. In February 1530 Wolsey was restored to his
    Archbishopric but without his palace, which the King kept for himself;
    he was summoned to London on a charge of treason, but he fell ill and
    died on the way.</p>

  <p>No Englishman before or after Wolsey has ever maintained so much state
    and splendour; no Englishman has ever affected the popular imagination
    so much as Cardinal Wolsey. Contemporary writers exhaust themselves in
    dwelling upon the more than regal Court kept up by this priest. It is
    like reading of the Court of a great king. We must, however, remember,
    that all this state was not the ostentation of the man so much as,
    first, the glorification of the Church and of the ecclesiastical
    dignities, and next, a visible proof of the greatness of the King in
    having so rich a subject.</p>

  <p>Between 1527 and 1534 there were disputes on the subject of tithes and
    offerings to the clergy. At this time began the dissolution of the
    Monasteries, to which we will return presently.</p>

  </div>

  <p>So far as regards the relations between the King and the City. Let
    us now return to the City itself. We have already seen that the
    intervals of freedom from plague were growing shorter. In this reign
    of thirty-eight years there was a return of the sweating sickness in
    1518; a return of the plague, which lasted from 1519 to 1522; another
    appearance of the sweating sickness in 1528; and another attack of
    the plague in 1543. It seems strange that no physician should have
    connected the frequency and violence of the disease with the foulness
    and narrowness of the streets. From the beginning of the sixteenth
    century to the Great Fire of 1666, London, crowded and confined,
    abounded with courts and slums of the worst possible kind; it swarmed
    with rogues and tramps and masterless men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> lived as they could,
    like swine. There were no great fires to cleanse the City. The
    condition of the ground, with its numberless cesspools, its narrow
    lanes into which, despite laws, everything was thrown; its frequent
    laystalls; the refuse and remains of all the workshops; the putrefying
    blood of the slaughtered beasts sinking into the earth,—must have
    been truly terrible had the people realised it; but they did not.
    Fluid matter sank into the earth and worked its wicked will unseen and
    unsuspected; the rains washed the surface; no man saw farther than the
    front of his own house; therefore when pestilence appeared among them
    it did not creep, according to its ancient wont, from house to house,
    but it flew swiftly with wings outspread over street and lane and court.</p>

  <p>Steps were taken to protect and to improve the medical profession. It
    was ordained in 1512 that no one should practise medicine or surgery
    within the City or for seven miles outside the City walls without a
    license from the Bishop of London or the Dean of St. Paul’s; the said
    license only to be obtained by examination before the Bishop or the
    Dean by four of the Faculty. Two years later surgeons were exempted
    from serving on juries, bearing arms, or serving as constables. In 1519
    the Physicians obtained a Charter of Incorporation, by which they were
    allowed a common seal; to elect a President annually; to purchase and
    hold land; and to govern all persons practising physic within seven
    miles of London. The College of Physicians, observe, was at first only
    considered as one of the City Companies: it had jurisdiction over
    London and over seven miles round London, but no more. The positions of
    both Physicians and Surgeons were enormously improved by these Acts of
    Parliament.</p>

  <p>There were in this reign, for the admiration of the people, an
    extraordinary number of executions, both of noble lords and hapless
    ladies, as well as of divines, monks, friars, gentlemen, gentlewomen,
    and the common sort, for treason, heresy, and the crimes which are
    the most commonly brought before the attention of justice. What reign
    before this would exhibit such a list as the following? Two Queens,
    Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard; of others, the Marquis of Exeter,
    the Earl of Surrey, the Earl of Kildare, the Duke of Buckingham,
    Lord Rochford, Lady Rochford, Lady Salisbury, Fisher, More, Empson,
    Dudley, Cromwell. Of abbots, priors, monks, friars, doctors, priests,
    for refusing the oath of the King’s supremacy a great number; of
    lesser persons for heresy or treason another goodly company. Some
    were beheaded—those were fortunate; others were burned, not being so
    fortunate; the rest were drawn on hurdles, and treated in the manner we
    have already seen.</p>

  <p>The dissolution of the Religious Houses, the changes in the Articles
    of Religion, and their effect upon the City of London, will be found
    in another place (see <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>). In this chapter a few cases are given
    to illustrate the changes of thought and the general excitement in the
    minds of men.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>There is, first, the case of Lambert. He was a learned man and a
    schoolmaster who denied the Real Presence in the Sacrament. The
    case had been already brought before the Archbishop, who had given
    a sentence against Lambert. The King, who ardently believed in the
    Real Presence, announced his intention of arguing publicly with this
    heretic. The argument was actually held in Westminster Hall in the
    presence of a great number of people. In the end the King, apparently,
    got the worst of it, for we find him becoming judge as well as
    disputant, and ordering the unfortunate man to recant or burn. Lambert
    would not recant—the pride and stubbornness of these heretics were
    wonderful; in some cases, perhaps in this, the man stood for a party:
    he would not recant for the sake of his friends as well as himself. He
    was burned.</p>

  <p>The case of Anne Askew is remarkable for the introduction of torture,
    which was then unusual either with criminals or heretics. She was so
    miserably tortured—yet perhaps the torture was intended as a merciful
    act, in the hope of rescuing her from worse than earthly flames—that
    she could not stand or walk. She, like Lambert, suffered for denying
    the Real Presence. She was a gentlewoman of very good understanding.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maid of Kent, Elizabeth Barton, was a woman of a much lower
    order. She was hysterical and weak-minded. At the present day she would
    be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> looked after and gently cared for. She had fits and convulsions,
    during which her face and her body were drawn, and she talked rambling
    nonsense. That she was unintelligible was quite enough to make the
    ignorant country folk flock about her, listening for inspired words in
    her hysterical ejaculations. She passed among them for one to whom God
    had sent a new revelation of His Will and Intentions. She was taken to
    see Bishops Fisher and More, who do not seem to have regarded her as a
    person of the slightest importance. But certain priests—it is said so;
    one may believe it or not—obtained influence over her and persuaded
    her to prophesy—no doubt she believed what they told her—that if the
    King took another wife he would not remain King for another year. Henry
    was not the man to be turned aside from his fixed purpose by such a
    gross cheat. He arrested the Maid and her accomplices. They were all
    brought to the Star Chamber and examined; they all confessed. They were
    then exposed on a scaffold at St. Paul’s and publicly confirmed their
    confessions. Her confederates included six ecclesiastics, of whom two
    were monks of Canterbury and one a Friar Observaunt; two were private
    gentlemen; one was a serving-man. Confession made, they were taken
    back to the Tower and their case laid before Parliament, which met
    after Christmas. They were all sentenced to the same traitor’s death
    and, after being kept in prison for three months, were carried out to
    Tyburn. The last words of the girl if they are correctly reported are
    very pathetic and to the purpose. But they look as if they had been
    written for her.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Hether am I come to die, and I have not beene the onele cause of
      mine owne death, which most justly I have deserved, but also I am
      the cause of the death of all these persons which at thys time here
      suffer: and yet to saye the truth I am not so much to be blamed,
      consydering it was well known unto these learned men that I was
      a poore wenche, without learnyng, and therefore they might have
      easily perceyved that the thinges that were done by me could not
      proceede in no suche sort, but their capacities and learning coulde
      right well judge from whence they were proceeded, and that they
      were altogether fayned: but because the things which I fayned was
      profitable unto them, and therefore they much praised mee and bare
      me in hande that it was the holy ghost, and not that I did them,
      and then being puffed up with their prayses, fell into a certaine
      pride and foolish phantasie with my self, and thought I might fayne
      what I would, which thing hath brought me to this case, and for the
      which now I crye God and the King’s highnesse most hartely mercie,
      and desire all you good people to pray to God to have mercie on me,
      and all them that here suffer with me.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One cannot refrain in this place from remarking on the change which
    has come over the temper of the people as regards the sacred person
    of the priest. Henry the Seventh would not send to execution even
    those mischievous priests who invented and carried out the impudent
    personations. Yet his son, thirty years later, sends to block, stake or
    gallows, bishops, abbots, priors, priests, monks, and friars, by the
    dozen.</p>

  <p>The story of Richard Hun illustrates the condition of popular feeling
    which made these executions of ecclesiastics possible. He was a
    citizen of good position and considerable wealth, a merchant-taylor by
    calling; he was greatly respected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> the poorer sort on account of
    his charitable disposition. “He was a good almesman and relieved the
    needy.” It happened that one of his children, an infant, died and was
    buried. The curate asked for the “bearing sheet” as a “mortuary.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    Richard Hun replied that the child had no property in the sheet. The
    reply shows either bad feeling towards the curate or bad feeling
    towards the clergy generally. Most likely it was the latter, as the
    sequel shows.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The priest cited him before the spiritual court. He replied by counsel,
    suing the curate in a praemunire. In return Hun was arrested on a
    charge of Lollardry and put into Lambeth Palace. And here shortly
    afterwards he was found dead. He had hanged himself, said the Bishop
    and Chancellor. The people began to murmur. Hanged himself? Why should
    so good a man hang himself? A coroner’s inquest was held upon the body.
    The jury indicted the Chancellor and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>two men, the bell-ringer and the
    summoner, for murdering Richard Hun. The King’s attorney, however,
    would go no further in the matter. By the Bishop’s orders the body was
    burned at Smithfield. But the murder—if it was a murder—of Richard
    Hun was not forgotten. Nor was it forgotten that without a trial his
    body was burned as a heretic’s. These things lay in the minds of the
    people. And they rankled.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Henry VI. (1447), four new grammar schools had been
    established in the City: viz. in the parishes of All Hallows the
    Great; St. Andrew’s Holborn; St. Peter’s Cornhill; and in St. Thomas
    Acons’ Hospital. Nine years later, five other parish schools had been
    founded or restored, namely, that of St. Paul’s; of St. Martin’s; of
    St. Mary le Bow; of St. Dunstan’s in the East; and of St. Anthony’s
    Hospital. All these schools seem to have fallen more or less into decay
    during the next hundred years. But very little indeed is known as to
    the condition of education during this period. There is, however, no
    doubt that in the year 1509 the Dean of St. Paul’s, John Colet, found
    the condition of St. Paul’s School very much decayed. He was himself
    a man of large means, being the son of a rich merchant who had been
    Sheriff in 1477, Mayor in 1486, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> Alderman, first of Farringdon Ward
    Without, and afterwards of Castle Baynard and Cornhill successively.
    The Dean resolved upon building a new school and endowing it. He
    therefore bought a piece of land on the east side of the Cathedral;
    there placed a school and entrusted the revenues with which he endowed
    it to the Mercers’ Company, saying, that though there was nothing
    sacred in human affairs, he yet found the “least corruption” among
    them. Later on, the Merchant Taylors founded a school; the Mercers
    founded another school; and John Carpenter, Clerk, founded the City of
    London School. The educational endowments founded by London citizens
    amount to nearly a hundred.</p>

  <p>The enclosure of common lands has always been a temptation to those
    who live in the neighbourhood and a grievance to those who are thus
    robbed of their common property. Both in the north and south of London
    there stretched wide common lands in which the people possessed rights
    of pasture, cutting wood, and other things. Many of these common lands
    still remain, though greatly shorn of their former proportions. On
    the north Hampstead Heath is all that is left of land which began at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    Moorfields and stretched northwards as far as Muswell Hill and Highgate
    and eastward to include the Forests of Epping and Hainault. In a map of
    London of the sixteenth century these common lands must be laid down
    as a special and very fortunate possession of the City, where people
    could in a few minutes find themselves in pure country air. Early in
    the century, however, there were murmurings on account of the enclosure
    of the fields north of London. “Before this time,” says Grafton, “the
    townes about London, as Islington, Hoxton, Shordyche, and other, had
    enclosed the common fields with hedges and ditches that neyther the
    yonge men of the City might shoote, nor the auncient persons might
    walk for their pleasure in the fields, except eyther their bowes and
    arrows were broken or taken away, or the honest and substantiall
    persons arrested or indicted, saiving that no Londoner should goe oute
    of the City but in the high wayes.” It is not stated how long this
    grievance lasted; probably it grew gradually: field after field was
    cut off; one enclosure after another was made; until the Londoners
    rubbed their eyes and asked each other what had become of their ancient
    grounds—especially the delightful fields called the Moor, on whose
    shallow ponds they skated and slid in winter, and where they practised
    the long bow, while the elders looked on, in the summer. They were
    gone: in their place were fields hedged and ditched, with narrow
    lanes in which two people might walk abreast. How long they looked
    on considering this phenomenon we know not. At length, however, the
    pent-up waters overflowed. “Suddenly this yere” (1514) a great number
    of people assembled in the City, and a “Turner” attired in a fool’s
    coat ran about among them crying, “Shovels and Spades.” Everybody knew
    what was meant. In an incredibly short time the whole population of
    the City were outside the walls, armed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> shovels and spades. Then
    the ditches were filled in, and hedges cut down, and the fields laid
    open again. The King’s Council, hearing of the tumult, came to the Grey
    Friars and sent for the Mayor to ascertain the meaning, for a tumult in
    the City might become a very serious thing indeed. When, however, they
    heard the cause and meaning of it they “dissimuled” the matter with a
    reasonable admonition to attempt no more violence, and went home again.
    But the fields were not hedged in or ditched round any more.</p>

  <p>In 1532 there was held a general Muster of all the citizens aged
    from sixteen to sixty. The City, never slow to display its strength
    and wealth, turned out in great force. The men mustered at Mile End,
    probably because it was the nearest place which afforded a broad
    space for marshalling the troops. They were dressed in white uniforms
    with white caps and white feathers; the Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen,
    and Recorder wore white armour, having black velvet jackets with the
    City arms embroidered on them, and gold chains. Before each Alderman
    marched four halberdiers, each with a gilt halberd. Before the Lord
    Mayor marched sixteen men in white satin jackets, with chains of gold
    and long gilt halberds; four footmen in white satin; and two pages
    in crimson velvet, with gold brocade waistcoats; two stately horses
    carrying, the one the Mayor’s helmet, the other the Mayor’s pole-axe.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All citizens of distinction on such occasions wore white satin
    jackets and gold chains. The vast expenditure of money on a single
    day’s pageant such as this, was quite common at this time and in the
    preceding age. It may perhaps be explained by certain considerations.
    Thus: it was an age of great show and external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> splendour; the
    magnificence of dress, festivals, masques, ridings, and pageants,
    is difficult to realise in this sober time. Wealth, rank, position,
    privileges, were in fact marked by display. We have seen the splendour
    of the Baron who rode to his town house with an army of 500 followers
    all richly dressed. And it has been observed that it was not wholly the
    mere love of magnificence that caused a nobleman or an ecclesiastic
    to keep up this great state. So, in preparing this martial show,
    with 15,000 men of arms all fully and richly equipped, the Mayor and
    Aldermen intended to illustrate to the King and his Ministers the power
    of the City, the wealth of the City, and the resolution of the City to
    defend their liberties. And I have no doubt that this intention was
    thoroughly understood by Henry and taken to heart. The March began at
    nine in the morning. The troops marched through Aldgate, through the
    City, and so to Westminster by Fleet Street and the Strand—a little
    over four miles. At five in the evening the last company marched past
    the King. That part of the business therefore must have lasted about
    six hours.</p>

  <p>In the matter of the King’s divorce the City, or the populace, had
    taken a very strong side in favour of Queen Katherine. It may indeed
    be true that the King’s conscience was awakened after all these years
    of marriage as to the legality of marrying his brother’s widow: he saw
    perhaps in the failure of male heirs a sign of the Divine displeasure;
    that may be: it is not possible to understand all the motives which
    guide a man. To the outside world the simplest motive seems always the
    certain motive. Katherine was no longer young, no longer beautiful.
    Anne Boleyn was both. When the second marriage was announced, the
    citizens were greatly displeased: partly on account of their sympathy
    with Katherine, partly because they remembered that Anne was the
    grand-daughter of a mayor, one of themselves. No honour is ever felt
    to be conferred upon the people by the marriage of a Prince with one
    of themselves, but quite the reverse. Edward IV. and James II. are
    examples, as well as Henry VIII. So much did the citizens show their
    disgust, that at an Easter sermon some of them went out of the church
    before the prayers for the Queen were read. The King sent word to the
    Mayor about it. He called the guilds together and bade them cease
    murmuring against the King’s marriage, and cause their journeymen and
    apprentices and even their wives to offend no more.</p>

  <p>On the 29th of May the Queen passed from Greenwich to the Tower, and
    on the 31st from the Tower to Westminster. The City hastened on this
    occasion to show their loyalty by preparing a splendid reception for
    the Queen. The Pageant is described below.</p>

  <p>The Princess Elizabeth was born in September of the same year (1533).
    In the spring of the following year Parliament passed an Act of
    Succession declaring that she, and not Mary, was heir to the Crown; the
    whole of the citizens took the oath in acknowledgment of this Act. If
    any were so hardy as to refuse, they were executed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

  <p>Of Pageants and Ridings no reign ever saw so many, nor was the City
    ever more honoured in the part which it was invited to take in them.
    Here, for instance, is a list of the more important: the Coronation
    in 1509; the reception of the French Ambassadors in 1518; that of the
    Legate Cardinal Campeggio; that of the Emperor Charles in 1522; the
    Coronation of Anne Boleyn;—every one an occasion for the display of
    sumptuous raiment, tapestry, gold chains and allegorical groups. Two
    of these functions stand out above all others: the Coronation of Anne
    and the Christening of her child. Let us take the account of the Water
    Pageant as furnished by Grafton:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The xix day of May the Maior and his brethren all in Scarlet, and
      such as were knightes had collers of Esses and the remnaunt havyng
      good chaynes, and the counsayle of the Citie with them assembled
      at saint Marie Hyll, and at one of the clocke dissended to the
      Newstayre to their Barge, which was garnished with many goodly
      Banners and instruments, which continually made goodly armony.
      After that the Maior and his brethren were in their Barge seing
      that al the companies to the number of fiftie Barges were readie to
      wayte upon them. They gave commaundement to the companies that no
      Barge should rowe neerer to another then twise the length of the
      Barge upon a great paine. And to see the order kept, there were
      three light Wheryes prepared, and in every one of them two officers
      to call on them to keepe their order, after which commaundement
      given they set foorth in order as hereafter is described. First
      before the Maior’s Barge was a Foyst or Wafter full of ordynaunce,
      in which Foyst was a great Dragon contynually moovyng, and casting
      wilde fyre: and round about the sayde Foyst stood terrible monsters
      and wilde men casting fire, and making hideous noyses: next after
      the Foyst a good distaunce came the Maior’s Barge, on whose right
      hand was the Batchelers’ Barge, in the which were Trumpets and
      divers other melodious Instruments. The deckes of the sayde Barge
      and the sailyardes and the top Castels were hanged with riche cloth
      of Golde and silke. At the foreship and the sterne were two great
      banners riche beaten with the armes of the King and the Quene, and
      on the top Castell also was a long streamer newely beaten with the
      sayde armes.</p>

    <p>At three of the clock the Queene appered in riche clothe of Gold
      and entered into her Barge accompanied with divers Ladies and
      gentlewomen, and incontinent the Citizens set forwardes in their
      order, their Musicians continually plaiyng, and the Batchelers’
      Barge goyng on the Queenes right hande, which she toke great
      pleasure to behold. About the Queenes Barge were many Noblemen,
      as the Duke of Suffolke, the Marques Dorset, the Erie of Wilshire
      her father, the Erles of Arrondell, Darby, Rutland, Worcester,
      Huntyngton, Sussex, Oxford, and many Bishoppes and noblemen, every
      one in his Barge which was a goodly sight to behold. Shee thus
      being accompanied rowed toward the Tower, and in the meane waye the
      shippes which were commaunded to lye on the shore for lettyng of
      the Barges shot divers peales of Gonnes, and or shee landed there
      was a marvailous shot out of the Tower as ever was harde there.
      And at her landing there met with her the Lorde Chamberlaine with
      the officers of armes and brought her to the king, which received
      her with lovyng countenance at the posterne by the waterside, and
      kyssed her, and then she turned back againe and thanked the Maior
      and the citizens with many goodly words and so entered the Tower.”
      (Grafton’s <i>Chronicles</i>, vol. ii. p. 448.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Insurrection in the North, called the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most
    dangerous rising in this reign, caused the King to look to the City for
    assistance. The Mayor sent him 300 men fully armed and equipped.</p>

  <p>The Mayor took another step in the interests of the Crown and of order.
    Although the suppression of the Houses was only begun, the intention of
    the King was manifest, and the rising in the North showed the temper of
    some part of the people. It is probable that in the City the popular
    voice was with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> King. But there was a minority consisting of some
    of the monks and friars ejected, some of the people who had lost their
    occupation and their service, some partisans of the old order; and
    these were dangerous. The Court of Aldermen, therefore, deprived every
    priest, monk, friar, and religious person of every kind, of all weapons
    except their meat knives. A rising of the Religious, maddened with rage
    and fear, joined by one knows not how many of lay partisans, hot-heads
    and ribalds always anxious for a row, might have been a very serious
    thing indeed. We may be quite sure that there were many within and
    without the walls who would have desired nothing so much as the sack
    and pillage of the rich merchants’ houses in the sacred name of the
    Holy Church. Perhaps one of the reasons of the City’s acquiescence in
    the destruction of the Religious Houses was the knowledge that such a
    rebellion would have produced some kind of alliance with the rogues and
    vagabonds of their lanes and slums.</p>

  <p>The execution of Anne Boleyn and the succession of Henry’s queens may
    be passed over here as belonging to the national history.</p>

  <p>In June and July 1536 a Convocation was held at St. Paul’s, presided
    over by Cromwell, the King’s Vicar-General. A more important assembly
    was never held in this country. For this Convocation separated the
    Church of England altogether from Rome: it held that the King, as
    Supreme Head of the Church, ought to disregard all citations from
    the Pope. Once before the Pope’s citations had been disregarded and
    scoffed at, viz. by John; but that was on his own authority, apart
    from his Clergy and his people. In this case Henry kept up the show of
    consultation with his Clergy. Not he, but Convocation, decided that he
    was wholly independent of the Pope.</p>

  <p>In the year 1543 the plague appeared and carried off a great many. The
    City Authorities ordered all infected houses to be marked with a cross;
    all infected persons who recovered were to remain in quarantine for a
    month; all straw and rushes from infected houses were to be carried
    away and burned; and infected clothes were to be carried out of the
    City. Dogs, except watch-dogs, were to be killed. It proved, happily,
    to be a short though sharp visitation.</p>

  <p>In 1544 the City sent 1000 men to aid Henry in his war with France,
    in two contingents of 500 each; and in the following year a third
    contingent of 2000 men was sent to France. In 1545 a tax for
    two-fifteenths was imposed for the purpose of bringing water from
    Hackney, Muswell Hill, and Hoxton, into the City. The conclusion of the
    war with France in 1546 was celebrated by a Procession which was solemn
    and magnificent. It marched from St. Paul’s to Leadenhall Chapel and
    back again. First came men carrying the silver crosses of the Parish
    Churches; then all the Parish Clerks, Choristers and Priests in London;
    then the Choir of St. Paul’s, in their school caps: they were followed
    by the City Companies in their liveries. Last of all marched the Lord
    Mayor and Aldermen in scarlet robes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

  <p>Peace, however, brought with it an invasion of disbanded soldiers,
    riotous, and given to acts of robbery and violence. They were
    accompanied by their camp-followers, whose character may be guessed.
    The Mayor gave orders that the old soldiers should be allowed to beg
    for a certain number of days, but that the vagabond followers should be
    driven out of the City. So I suppose they got rid of a few while the
    greater number remained behind—an addition to the rogues and beggars
    of the City, who had already become a most dangerous element. (See
    <a href="#Page_366">p. 366</a>.)</p>

    <div class="caption">EMBARKATION OF HENRY VIII. AT DOVER</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the last year of Henry’s reign (1546) he bestowed an endowment of
    500 marks a year on the City Poorhouses on condition that the City
    itself raised as much. He also gave the City, only a few days before
    his death, the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, to be called the House of
    the Poor; the House of the Grey Friars, and the House or Hospital of
    Bethlehem. Henry died on the 28th of January 1547 at his Palace of
    Whitehall.</p>

  <p>I will now discuss a few more incidents in the history of this reign.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>In 1511 Roger Acheley, Mayor, caused the City Granary of Leadenhall to
    be stored with grain for prevention in time of scarcity. This Mayor
    also caused Moor fields to be levelled, and bridges and causeways to be
    erected thereon.</p>

  <p>In 1512 the Sheriffs were, by Act of Parliament, empowered to empanel
    Juries for the City Courts. Every Juryman was to be a citizen worth
    100 marks. If he failed to appear upon the first summons he was to
    forfeit one shilling and eightpence; for the second, three shillings
    and fourpence—and so on, the penalty being doubled for each occasion.</p>

  <p>In 1517 the Court of Conscience was first established. Two Aldermen
    and four “discreet” Commoners were appointed every month to sit at
    the Guildhall twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday, to hear causes
    between citizens and freemen of debts not exceeding forty shillings.
    The Act was passed for two years only; but as it proved highly
    serviceable it was continued by repeated Acts of Council until the
    Court was confirmed by James I.</p>

  <p>In 1519 the King by Charter removed the Sessions of Peace from St.
    Martin’s le Grand to the Guildhall, to the great contentment of the
    citizens.</p>

  <p>In 1519 the Tower Ditch, between Aldgate and the Tower Postern, was
    scoured and cleansed—the work cost £95:3:4. The Chief Ditcher was
    paid 7d. a day; the second Ditcher 6d.; the rest 5d.; the “Vagabonds,”
    <i>i.e.</i> men pressed into the work, got a penny and their food. It
    follows from this that the wage of a working man was then 5d. or 6d. a
    day. The pay of a chantry priest was in most cases £6 a year, or about
    4d. a day. So that the craftsman received, to support himself and his
    family, very little more than the priest for the support of himself.
    This fact shows that even the despised chantry priest occupied a much
    higher social position than the craftsman.</p>

  <p>In 1525 Wolsey proposed to levy a tax of one-sixth of all the goods
    and chattels of the laity, and a fourth of those of the clergy.
    There was so much indignation at this tax that the King gave way,
    sending a letter to the Mayor in which he stated that he would never
    exact anything of his people by compulsion, but would rely on their
    benevolence. It appeared, however, when Wolsey sent for the Mayor and
    Aldermen to confer with them upon the subject, that the City was not
    disposed to grant any benevolence at all, relying on a statute of
    Richard III. abolishing such benevolences. It was in vain that Wolsey
    pointed out to them the facts that Richard was a murderer and a tyrant:
    the City stood by the Law, and the benevolence was dropped.</p>

  <p>In 1526 occurs an early example of the boycott. The City found that
    certain foreign merchants had purchased license to import woad contrary
    to law. It was therefore resolved that no London citizen should have
    any dealings with any foreign merchant who should import woad.</p>

  <p>About the year 1527 there was an attempt made by Wolsey to pass laws in
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> teeth of the simple rule of supply and demand. The war with Spain
    caused great losses to the manufacturers of cloth, who were obliged to
    dismiss their servants and to stop the production. Wolsey thereupon
    sent for the principal merchants of the City and ordered them to go
    on buying from the manufacturers as usual; in other words, to ruin
    themselves and their own servants in order to prevent the dismissal of
    the factory hands. Should they disobey, the great Cardinal threatened
    to remove the cloth market from Blackwell Hall to Westminster.
    “However,” Maitland remarks quietly, “it was neither in the power
    of the King, nor in that of his Minister, to execute the aforesaid
    injunction: wherefore commerce continued on the same footing as before,
    till the conclusion of a Peace.”</p>

  <p>In 1529, after the meeting of Convocation already mentioned, a
    Proclamation was passed in London prohibiting all commercial
    intercourse with Rome.</p>

  <p>In the same year the City recovered the right of the Great Beam. The
    King had taken over this important right with all the profits belonging
    to it and had conveyed it to Sir William Sidney. For ten years the
    City had been endeavouring to recover their rights even by bribing,
    but without success. In 1531 a compromise was arrived at, by which
    Sir William Sidney continued to hold the Beam at an annual rent, and
    by Royal Charter the right was once more conveyed to the Mayor and
    Corporation, the Grocers’ Company having the privilege of appointing
    the weighers.</p>

  <p>Another attempt was made to regulate the price of food. It was
    complained that butchers who were not freemen had put up stalls along
    Leadenhall Street where they sold their meat before the doors of the
    houses. The Mayor made them all go into Leadenhall Market, where they
    had to pay rent to the Corporation. He also fixed the price of beef
    at a half-penny a pound, and of mutton at three-farthings. As a whole
    sheep could be bought for 2s. 10d., it would seem as if the whole sheep
    weighed only 45 lbs. It was discovered, however, that the regulation
    only made meat dearer. Therefore it was not enforced. At this time
    French wine was sold at 8d. a gallon; Malmsey and other sweet wines at
    a shilling.</p>

  <p>In 1542 occurred the business of George Ferrers. He was M.P. for
    Plymouth, and he was arrested for debt in the City and lodged in the
    Compter, a manifest infringement of the privileges of the House. The
    Serjeant-at-Arms was therefore ordered by the House to proceed to the
    City and to demand the release of the prisoner. The Sheriffs—Rowland
    Hill and Henry Suckley—in their zeal for the privileges of Parliament,
    not only refused to obey, but abused the serjeant and maltreated him.
    Upon which he returned to Westminster and informed the House of what
    had been done. The House therefore ordered the serjeant to return
    and to demand the prisoner without writ or warrant. Meanwhile the
    Sheriffs had learned the meaning of their action and were beginning
    to feel uncomfortable. They released the prisoner and, accompanied
    by the creditor, one White, they attended at the Bar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> of the House.
    The Sheriffs and the creditor and one of their clerks were sent to
    the Tower; the arresting clerk and four others to Newgate. And in
    this melancholy plight they continued for some days, until they were
    released by the intercession of the Mayor. This was an example to all
    future Sheriffs not to take too much upon themselves.</p>

  <p>About this time also the principal streets of the suburbs were first
    completely paved: viz. Holborn, High Street, Aldgate as far as
    Whitechapel Church, Chancery Lane, Gray’s Inn Lane, Shoe Lane, Fetter
    Lane, White Cross Street, Chiswell Street, Grub Street, Shoreditch,
    Goswell Street, St. John’s Street, Cannon Street, Wych Street,
    Holy Well Street (by Clement Danes), the Strand; Petty France in
    Westminster; Water Lane in Fleet Street; Long Lane in Smithfield; and
    Butcher Row without Temple Bar. The paving was not yet the flat slab of
    stone introduced later, but the round cobble stone, with a channel or
    gutter running down the middle.</p>

  <p>In 1543 an Act was passed empowering the City to bring water from
    Hampstead and Muswell Hill, and two years later a conduit was set up in
    Lothbury with water from Hoxton Fields. (<a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I.</a>)</p>

  <p>The death of Henry left the City in a condition of the greatest
    confusion and disorder. The streets were full of returned soldiers, and
    of the idle vagabonds who follow the army: in holes and corners there
    were lurking unfrocked friars and people turned out of their work in
    the Religious Houses; there were no hospitals for the sick; none for
    the blind; none for the insane. If these were the fruits of the King’s
    supremacy, then, men whispered to each other, it were better to return
    to the old superstitions.</p>

      From a portrait by Holbein at Windsor Castle.</div>
  </div>

  <p>There can be no doubt whatever that just as in the reign of Richard II.
    the City was saturated with Lollardry, so in the last years of Henry
    VIII. it was filled with the new ideas. The connection with the Pope
    severed; the religious Orders clean swept away; the reading of the
    Bible rapidly spreading; the teaching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> example of men like Cranmer,
    Latimer, Rogers, Ridley, Hooper, and others; the derision poured upon
    the old things such as pilgrimages, image worship, repeated services
    and monasticism; the popular attack on the Religious by such writers
    as Fish in the <i>Supplicacyon of Beggars</i> and Barnabe Googe in his
    <i>Popish Kingdom</i>; the lectures and sermons carefully composed with the
    design of overthrowing and casting contempt upon the old Faith; the
    natural instinct of men to see in new ideas a certain remedy for old
    ills;—these things made it inevitable that the new thoughts should
    spread and take root. We hear no more, for instance, of the Mayor
    disarming men who had been monks and friars.</p>

  <p>The new ideas, again, appealed to the nobler and more generous part of
    humanity. To stand erect before the Creator without the intervention
    of a priest; no longer to be called upon to believe that which the
    Bible would not allow to be believed; the introduction of Reason into
    the domain of Doctrine; the abandonment of childish pilgrimages to the
    tombs of fallible and sinful mortals; the abolition of the doctrine
    that pardons, indulgences, Heaven itself, can be bought with money; no
    longer to believe that fasting and the observance of days may avail to
    salvation;—these things caught hold of men’s minds and ran rapidly
    from class to class. And then there was the reading of the Bible for
    themselves by the folk who could do no more than read. There are no
    means of deciding how far the old English Version had been read and
    passed from hand to hand.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Edward VI. we see the first-fruits of the new ideas.
    Already, however, there were signs of change other than those ordered
    and authorised by the most autocratic of sovereigns. The Mayor
    abolished the service of the Boy Bishop at St. Paul’s; sober citizens
    were haled before the courts charged with blaspheming the mass; men
    rose in their places and made a noise in church during celebration;
    one, a boy, threw his cap at the Host during the time of elevation:
    “at this tyme” (<i>Grey Friars Chron.</i>) “was moche spekyng agayn the
    Sacrament of the Auter, that some called it Jack of the boxe, with
    divers other shameful names.”</p>

  <p>Thus the new reign began.</p>

  <p>It was a time of great uncertainty and trouble in religious matters. We
    see the citizens, ignorant of Greek, disputing over the interpretation
    of a text; over the conditions of salvation; over matters too high for
    them—one grows hot and says things that ought not to be said. The
    informer in the crowd—there is always an informer—steals away and
    lays information. Then the hasty citizen is lucky if he gets off with
    a fine. They whisper thus and thus concerning the intentions of the
    Protector and the opinions of the Archbishop. It is rumoured that the
    new Bishop of this or that will not be consecrated in his robes; it is
    rumoured that there will be more changes in the Articles of Religion;
    it is rumoured that there will be a vast rising of the ejected priests
    and the starving friars; it is rumoured that they have already risen in
    the East and in the West. The air is full of rumours. Trade is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> very
    bad. There is no money anywhere; the coinage is debased: a shilling
    is worth no more than sixpence; a groat is twopence; a penny is a
    half-penny; and the price of provisions is certainly double what it
    was! It is a strange, perplexed time.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_047"><img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="378" height="482" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">EDWARD VI. (1537–1553)<br />
      From a portrait by Holbein at Windsor Castle.</div>
  </div>

  <p>There were other events connected with the City besides these constant
    alarms about the change of Faith. Traitors were executed, notably the
    two Seymours; rebels were drawn, hanged and quartered, notably the four
    Captains of the Cornish Rising; the sweating sickness appeared again
    in 1550 and lasted for six months, carrying off men only and sparing
    women and children. The cloister of St. Paul’s, commonly called the
    Dance of Death, and the Charnel House of St. Paul’s, were destroyed and
    carried away; there were risings in Cornwall, Norfolk, and Yorkshire;
    a woman named Joan of Kent was burned at Smithfield for heresy; then
    happened the famous murder of Arden of Faversham, for which his wife,
    his maid, and one of the murderers were all burned; three men and one
    woman hanged; a Dutchman named George of Paris was burned for heresy in
    Smithfield.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

  <p>An important acquisition, however, was gained by the City in 1550. The
    Borough of Southwark consisted of three manors, the Guildable Manor,
    the King’s Manor, and the Great Liberty Manor. Edward III. had granted
    the first of these to the City. Edward IV. had confirmed and amplified
    this grant, giving the City the right of holding a yearly Fair in the
    month of September together with a Court of Pie Powder. The City next
    claimed the right of holding a market twice a week in Southwark. On
    this claim there were disputes. Finally the City bought all the rights
    of the Crown in Southwark for the sum of £647:2:1. They thus obtained
    a recognised right to hold four weekly markets, and to administer the
    whole borough excepting the two prisons of the Marshalsea and the
    King’s Bench, and the Duke of Suffolk’s House.</p>

  <p>A very curious difference was made between the new Ward of Bridge
    Without, then founded, and the other wards. It is this: that in the
    election of Aldermen the people of the Ward have never had any voice
    and have never taken any part. And they are not represented in the
    Common Council.</p>

  <p>In one respect the civic history of this reign is very fine—the
    citizens grappled manfully with the question of the poor and the
    sick. We have seen how Henry gave them Grey Friars, Bartholomew’s,
    and Bethlehem. In aid of the former they levied on the City a tax of
    one-half of a fifteenth, <i>i.e.</i> a thirtieth. And the memory of the
    old Religious Fraternities lingered still, for we find them founding
    a Brotherhood for the Relief of the Poor, to which Sir John Gresham,
    then Mayor, and most of the Aldermen belonged. Nor was this all. They
    obtained by purchase, at the cost of £2500, the Hospital of St. Thomas
    in Southwark.</p>

  <p>After the poor, the children. Grey Friars House was taken in hand and
    altered to convert it into a school. In a few months 400 children were
    admitted. This was the work of Sir Richard Dobbs as Mayor. When Ridley
    was lying in prison, shortly before his death he wrote to Dobbs in
    these words:—“Oh Dobbs, Dobbs, Alderman and Knight, thou in thy year
    didst win my heart for evermore, for that honourable act, that most
    blessed work of God, of the erection and setting up of Christ’s Holy
    Hospitals and truly Religious Houses which by thee and through thee
    were begun.”</p>

  <p>After the sick and the children come those who cannot work and those
    who will not work. In 1553 the young King consented to give his disused
    Palace of Bridewell for the purpose of turning it into a Work-house
    or hospital for those who could work no longer, and for a House of
    Correction to those who would not work (see also <a href="#Page_368">p. 368</a>). The King
    gave also 700 marks and all the beds and bedding of the Palace of the
    Savoy. The very last act of Edward VI. was a Charter of Incorporation,
    appointing the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, Governors of these
    Royal Hospitals in the City.</p>

      From E. Gardner’s Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the first year of Edward the House of Commons passed an Act which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>showed that the old spirit of independence and the desire to form
    Unions were not dead among the craftsmen of London. They enacted:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That if any Artificers, Workmen, or Labourers do conspire,
      covenant, or promise together, that they shall not make or do
      their work but at a certain Price or Rate, or shall not enterprize
      nor take upon them to finish that work which another hath begun,
      or shall do but a certain work in a day, or shall not work but
      at certain Hours or Times; that then every Person so conspiring,
      covenanting, or offending, being thereof convicted by Witnesses,
      Confession, or otherwise, shall forfeit for the first offence
      £10 or twenty days’ Imprisonment; for the second offence £20 or
      Pillory; and for a third offence £40 or to sit on the Pillory,
      and to have one Ear cut off, besides being rendered infamous and
      incapable of ever giving Evidence upon Oath.” (Maitland, vol. i. p.
      239.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Act is explained to apply especially to butchers, bakers, brewers,
    poulterers, cooks, etc.—in a word, to those who provided the daily
    necessaries of life.</p>

  <p>In 1548 the Marching Watch was revived by Sir John Gresham, after being
    in abeyance for many years. It was London’s finest show. (See <a href="#Page_362">p. 362</a>.)</p>

  <p>The Deposition and trial of the Protector are matters of national
    history. The part taken by the City is not generally recorded by the
    historian. It is told by Maitland:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, and divers Lords of the Privy-Council,
      being highly dissatisfied with the Administration of <i>Edward
        Seymer</i>, Duke of <i>Somerset</i>, the Protector, withdrew from Court,
      associated, and armed themselves and Domesticks, and secured
      the Tower of <i>London</i> by a Stratagem of the Lord Treasurer’s,
      without the Effusion of Blood; and, having removed the Governor,
      substituted one of their Friends to succeed him. Having luckily
      succeeded in their first Attempt, <i>Warwick</i> removed into the City,
      and lodged at the House of <i>John York</i>, one of the Sheriffs of
      <i>London</i>.</p>

    <p>Upon advice of these proceedings at <i>London</i>, the Protector was
      so greatly intimidated, that he instantly removed with the King
      from <i>Hampton-Court</i> to <i>Windsor</i>, and began strongly to fortify
      the Castle. In the Interim the Lords at <i>London</i> had a Conference
      with the Lord-Mayor and Aldermen, whom they earnestly importuned
      to provide a Power sufficient for Defence of the City: Which being
      assented to, the several Companies were ordered alternately to
      mount Guard, to be ready to oppose all Attempts that might be
      made against them. They likewise desired a Supply of five hundred
      Men, to enable them to bring the Protector to Justice. To which
      Answer was returned, That nothing could be done in that Affair
      without consulting the Common-Council; to which End, the Lord-Mayor
      summoned all the Members thereof to assemble the next Day in
      <i>Guildhall</i>.</p>

    <p>In the mean time the Lords convened in the Mayor’s House; where
      after having drawn up a trifling charge against the Protector,
      they caused it to be proclaimed in divers parts of the City.
      After which they conferred with the Mayor and Aldermen in the
      Council-Chamber (before they met the Commons) and, having come
      to several Resolutions, the Mayor and Aldermen repaired to the
      Common-Council; where, in a full Assembly, they produced a Letter
      from the King, commanding them immediately to send him five hundred
      Men completely armed to <i>Windsor</i>. However, <i>Robert Brook</i>, the
      Recorder, earnestly exhorted them rather to supply the Lords with
      that Number, by whose assistance they would be enabled to call the
      Protector to an Account, and thereby redress the Grievances of an
      injured Nation; without which the City was not only in Danger of
      being ruined, but likewise the whole Kingdom to become a Prey to
      his insatiable Avarice. This Speech, instead of having the desired
      Effect, occasioned a profound Silence; which greatly amazing the
      Orator, he reassumed his Discourse, and seriously pressed them for
      an Answer: Whereupon <i>George Stadlow</i>, a prudent and judicious
      Citizen, rose up, and spoke as followeth:—</p>

    <p>‘I remember,’ sayth he, ‘in a Story written in Fabian’s Chronicle,
      of the Warre betweene the King and his Barons, which was in the
      time of King <i>Henry</i> III. and the same Time the Barons, as our
      Lordes do now, demaunded Ayde of the Maior and Citie of <i>London</i>,
      and that in a rightful Cause for the Commonweale, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>which was for
      the Execution of divers good Lawes, whereunto the King before
      had geven his Consent, and after would not suffer them to take
      Place; and the Citie did ayde the Lords, and it came to an open
      Battayl, wherein the Lordes prevayled, and toke the King and his
      sonne Prisoners, and upon certaine Condycions the Lordes restored
      againe the King and his Sonne to their Liberties; and, amonge other
      Condycions, this was one, That the King should not only graunt his
      Pardon to the Lordes, but also to the Citezens of <i>London</i>; which
      was graunted, yea, and the same was ratified by Act of Parliament:
      But what followed of it? Was it forgotten? No, surely, nor forgiven
      during the King’s life; the Lyberties of the City were taken away,
      Straungers appointed to be our Heades and Gouvernors, the Citezens
      geven away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> Bodye and Goodes, and from one Persecution to another
      were most miserably afflicted. Such it is to enter into the Wrath
      of a Prince, as <i>Solomon</i> sayth, <i>The Wrath and Indignation of a
        Prince is Death</i>. Wherefore, forasmuch as this Ayd is requyred of
      the King’s Majestie, whose Voyce we ought to hearken unto, for he
      is our high Shepherd, rather than unto the Lords; and yet I would
      not with the Lords to be clearly shaken off, but that they with
      us, and we with them, may joyne in Sute, and make our most humble
      Petition to the King’s Majestie, that it would please his Highness
      to heere suche Complaynt against the Government of the Lorde
      Protector, as maye be justly alleged and proved; and, I doubt not,
      but this Matter will be pacefied, that neither shall the King, nor
      yet the Lordes, have Cause to seeke for further Ayde, neyther we to
      offend any of them bothe.’” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 240.)</p>

  <p>It would seem that the nobles had resumed the old custom of having a
    great train of followers. For at the departure of Mary Queen of Scots
    from London, where she had been entertained for four days, the Duke
    of Northumberland attended her with a hundred mounted men, of whom
    forty were dressed in black velvet, with velvet hats and feathers,
    and had gold chains about their necks. The Earl of Pembroke was there
    with a hundred and twenty men, also in hats and feathers; and the
    Lord Treasurer had a hundred gentlemen and yeomen. The last glimpse
    which London had of the young King was when Sir Hugh Willoughby sailed
    down the river on that voyage which was to discover a N.E. passage
    through the ice and snow of North Siberia. The ships were dressed
    with streamers; trumpeters stood in the bows; guns were fired for a
    farewell salute as they passed Greenwich Palace, and the dying Prince
    was brought out for one more look upon the glory of his realm in the
    courage and enterprise of his subjects.</p>

      From a woodcut of the portrait by Antonio Moro, in Prado, Madrid.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It was on the evening of the 3rd of August that Mary made her entry
    into the City accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth. She came
    from Newhall in Essex where, a few days before, she had received a
    deputation from the City with a present of £500 in gold. At the Bars
    of Aldgate she was met by the Mayor, who gave her the City Sword. The
    order of the procession is related by a contemporary as follows:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“First, the citizens’ children walked before her magnificently
      dressed; after followed gentlemen habited in velvets of all sorts,
      some black, others in white, yellow, violet and carnation; others
      wore satins or taffety, and some damasks of all colours, having
      plenty of gold buttons; afterwards followed the Mayor, with the
      City Companies, and the chiefs or masters of the several trades;
      after them, the Lords, richly habited, and the most considerable
      knights; next came the ladies, married and single, in the midst of
      whom was the Queen herself, mounted on a small white ambling nag,
      the housings of which were fringed with gold thread; about her
      were six lacqueys, habited in vests of cloth of gold. The Queen
      herself was dressed in violet velvet, and was then about forty
      years of age, and ‘rather fresh-coloured.’ Before her were six
      lords bareheaded, each carrying in his hand a golden mace, and some
      others bearing the arms and crown. Behind her followed the archers,
      as well of the first as the second guard.... She was followed by
      her sister, named Madame Elizabeth, in truth a beautiful princess,
      who was also accompanied by ladies both married and single. Then
      might you hear the firing of divers pieces of artillery, bombards
      and canons, and many rejoicings made in the City of London; and
      afterwards the Queen, being in triumph and royal magnificence in
      her palace and castle of Oycemestre [Westminster], took it into
      her head to go and hear mass at Paules, that is to say, at the
      church of St. Paul, and she was attended by six hundred guards,
      besides the cere, that is to say the servants of lords and nobles.”
      (<i>Antiquarian Repertory.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the 10th of August the remains of the late King were buried
    according to the forms of the Book of Common Prayer. It was not long,
    however, before every one understood clearly the mind of the Queen.</p>

  <p>On the 1st of October Mary rode through the City to Westminster for her
    Coronation. Sharpe notes the significant fact that the daily service
    at St. Paul’s was not held because all the priests not suspended for
    Protestantism were wanted at Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p>Queen Mary was crowned with every possible care to return to the old
    ritual. Fresh oil, blessed by the Bishop of Arras, had been brought
    over; she was afraid that St. Edward’s Chair had been polluted by her
    brother, the Protestant, sitting in it; she had therefore another chair
    sent by the Pope. The death of Edward took place on the 6th of July
    1553, the Coronation of Mary on the 1st of October. The Queen must have
    requested the Pope to send her the chair immediately on her accession
    if that chair had arrived within eighty-five days.</p>

  <p>In November Lady Jane Grey, her husband, two of his brothers, and
    Cranmer, were tried at the Guildhall and sentenced to death; but
    execution was delayed. Probably in the case of Lady Jane Grey the
    sentence would never have been carried out had it not been for Wyatt’s
    Rebellion in January 1554. The ostensible cause was the Spanish match,
    which was regarded with the greatest dislike and suspicion by the whole
    people—“Yea, and thereat allmost eche man was abashed, looking daylie
    for worse matters to grow shortly after.” When the Rebellion broke
    out the City stood loyally by the Queen: the Companies set watch; no
    munitions of war were allowed to go out of the City; chains were set
    up at the Bridge foot; and 500 men were hurriedly raised and equipped.
    Mary herself showed the courage of her race. She rode into the City and
    met the citizens at the Guildhall, making them a very spirited speech.
    She spoke in a loud voice so that everyone <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>should hear. No action
    in her reign shows her nearly so well as this natural and courageous
    speech.</p>

  <p>The following is Mary’s speech as given by Maitland:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In my owne Person I am come unto you, to tell you that which
      yourselves already doe see and know; I mean, the traiterous and
      seditious Number of the <i>Kentish Rebels</i>, that are assembled
      against Us and You: Their Pretence, as they say, is to resist a
      Marriage between Us and the Prince of <i>Spain</i>. Of all their Plots,
      pretended Quarrels and evil-contrived Articles, you have been made
      privy.... What I am, loving Subjects, you right well know, your
      Queene, to whom at my Coronation, when I was wedded to the Realme,
      and to the Lawes of the same (the Spousal Ring whereof I have on
      my Finger, which never hitherto was, nor hereafter shall be left
      off), ye promised your Allegeance and Obedience unto me; and that
      I am the right and true Inheritor to the <i>English</i> Crown, I not
      only take all <i>Christendome</i> to Witness, but also your Acts of
      Parliaments confirming the same.</p>

    <p>And this I say further unto you in the Word of a Prince, I cannot
      tell how naturally a Mother loveth her Children, for I was never
      the Mother of any; but certainly, if a Prince and Governour may as
      naturally love their Subjects, as the Mother doth her Child, then
      assure yourselves, that I, being your Soveraigne Lady and Queene,
      doe as earnestly and tenderly love and favour you; and I, thus
      loving you, cannot but thinke, that you as heartily and faithfully
      love me againe; and so, this Love bound together in the Knot of
      Concord, we shall be able, I doubt not, to give these Rebels a
      short and speedy Overthrow....</p>

    <p>But if, as my Progenitors have done before, it might please God
      that I might leave some Fruit of my Body to be your Governour, I
      trust you would not only rejoice thereat, but also I know it would
      be to your great Comfort; and certainly if I either did know or
      thinke that this Marriage should either turne to the Danger or Loss
      of any of you, my loving Subjects, or to the Detriment of any Part
      of the Royal Estate of this <i>English</i> Realme, I would never consent
      thereunto, neither would I ever marry, whilst I lived.</p>

    <p>Wherefore, good Subjects, plucke up your Hearts, and, like true
      Men, stand fast with your lawful Prince against these Rebels, both
      ours and yours, and fear them not, for I assure you, I do not, and
      will leave with you my Lord <i>Howard</i> and my Lord Treasurer, to be
      assistant with my Lord-Maior, for the Safe-guard of the City from
      Spoile and Sackage, which is the onely Scope of this rebellious
      Company.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 249.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The failure of the revolt was due to the spirited and prompt action of
    the City.</p>

  <p>All this belongs to the history of the country. Yet we cannot pass
    over the execution of Lady Jane Grey. It is the most melancholy of
    all the many tragedies which belong to the Tower during the fifteenth
    and sixteenth centuries. Perhaps it seemed necessary at the time, in
    order to prevent other risings like that of Wyatt, in the same way that
    it had seemed necessary to Henry VII. that the young Earl of Warwick
    should be removed; and later to Elizabeth that Mary Queen of Scots
    should no longer be an occasion of conspiracy. At the same time it is
    wonderful that it should have been thought even possible to bring to
    the scaffold this girl of sixteen who had been made to play a part.
    The story of her execution and of her noble words, told with simple
    directness by Holinshed, cannot be read without tears:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“By this time was there a scaffold made upon the greene over
      against the White Tower, for the ladie Jane to die upon, who being
      nothing at all abashed, neither with feare of hir owne death, which
      then approched, neither with the sight of the dead carcasse of
      hir husband when he was brought into the chapell, came forth, the
      lieutenant leading hir, with countenance nothing abashed, nor hir
      eies anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> moistened with teares, with a booke in hir hand,
      wherein she praied untill she came to the said scaffold. Whereon
      when she was mounted, this noble yoong lady as she was indued with
      singular gifts both of learning and knowledge so was she as patient
      and mild as anie lambe at hir execution, and a little before hir
      death uttered these words:—</p>

    <p>‘Good people I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned
      to the same. My offence against the queenes highness was onelie in
      consent to the device of other, which now is deemed treason: but
      it was never of my seeking, but by counsell of those who should
      seem to have further understanding of things than I, which knew
      little of the law and much lesse of the titles to the crowne.
      But touching the procurement and desire thereof by me, or on my
      behalfe, I doo wash my hands in innocencie thereof before God,
      and the face of all you (good Christian people) this daie.’ And
      therewith she wroong her hands wherein she had hir booke. Then
      (said she) ‘I praie you all good Christian people, to beare me
      witnesse that I die a true Christian woman and that I looke to be
      saved by none other meanes, but onlie by the mercie of God, in the
      bloud of his onlie sonne Jesus Christ: and I confesse that when I
      did know the word of God, I neglected the same, and loved myselfe
      and the world, and therefore this plague and punishment is justlie
      and worthlie happened unto me for my sins, and yet I thanke God of
      his goodnesse, that he hath given me a time and respit to repent.
      And now, good people, while I am alive I praie you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> assist me with
      your praiers.’ Then kneeling downe she said the psalme of <i>Miserere
        mei Deus</i> in English, and then stood up and gave hir maid (called
      mistress Ellin) hir gloves and handkercher, and hir booke she also
      gave to maister Bridges the lieutenant of the Tower, and so untied
      her gowne: and the executioner pressed to helpe her off with it,
      but she desired him to let hir alone, and turned hir toward hir
      two gentlewomen, who helped hir off therewith, and with hir other
      attires, and they gave hir a faire handkercher to put about hir
      eies. Then the executioner kneeled downe and asked her forgiveness,
      whom she forgave most willinglie. Then he willed her to stand upon
      the straw, which doone, she saw the blocke and then she said, I
      praie you dispatch me quickly. Then she kneeled down saieng, Will
      you take it off before I laie me downe? Whereunto the executioner
      answered, No, Madame. Then tied she the handkercher about her eies
      and feeling for the blocke she said, Where is it? Where is it? One
      of the standers by guided her thereunto and she laid downe hir head
      upon the blocke and then stretched forth her bodie and said, Lord,
      into thy hands I commend my spirit; and so finished hir life.”
      (Holinshed, vol. iv. p. 22.)</p>

    <div class="caption">LADY JANE GREY (1537–1554)<br />
      After the portrait in the Collection of the Earl of Stamford and Warrington</div>
  </div>

  <p>Mary’s first Parliament met with the celebration of mass, which was
    ominous; but it was not too compliant: it was ready to restore the
    situation as it was in the last years of Henry VIII.; it was unwilling
    to submit to Rome; and it refused absolutely to restore the Church
    property. Further, it presented a petition against the proposed foreign
    marriage. Mary’s second Parliament, more obedient to the will of the
    Queen, gave its consent to the proposed marriage, but refused to
    re-enact the statute for the burning of heretics. Her third Parliament
    went a step farther: it re-enacted the statute for the burning of
    heretics; it agreed to reconciliation with Rome; but it refused, like
    its predecessors, to sanction the surrender of Church lands. They were
    ready to obey their sovereign in matters of faith: the soul may always
    be left to the care of the Church; but property—property—that, if
    you please, belongs to the Lay mind. Convocation, on the other hand,
    was very thorough: it denounced the Book of Common Prayer; it demanded
    the suppression of the Catechism; it recommended violent measures
    against the clergy who should deny the Real Presence and against those
    who should not put away their wives. This meant Revolution. Hosts of
    priests, and those who still survived from the monasteries, rejoiced
    to say mass once more, even in the ruined and desecrated churches that
    were left to them. It meant Restoration. Priests sprang up everywhere
    from the ground—how had they lived for ten years? Priests in the
    villages and the parish churches put on their old robes; dragged out
    the censing vessels; replaced the Host. Ex-monks who had been pensioned
    from the monasteries; ex-friars who had received no pensions but had
    been simply turned into the street; ecclesiastics from abroad;—all
    came, eager to revive the forbidden worship. They looked around them
    ruefully at the dishonoured shrines and the ruined chapels: it would
    take centuries to make everything as it had been; but still—one must
    try.</p>

  <p>Meantime, think, if you can, of the deadly hatred which these priests
    must have felt towards those who had done these mischiefs; think of
    the silent satisfaction with which even the best of them would witness
    the execution of one who had been a leader—a Hooper or a Latimer—in
    bringing about this destruction. But the destruction was stayed. Holy
    Church was back again, and of course for ever. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> Great Rebellion,
    they thought, was ended. As for the beneficed clergy in possession,
    many conformed for fear and for safety; very few indeed gave up their
    wives; happy were the contumacious if their contumacy brought no worse
    consequence than to beg their bread on the road; happy if it did not
    lead to a speedy trial, conviction, and the certainty of becoming a
    fiery example. They might have made up their minds at the outset that
    Mercy was not a quality for which Mary would be conspicuous. Before the
    Fires of Smithfield began there were the executions for the Rebellion
    of Wyatt. It was an excellent opportunity for winning the hearts of
    the people; Lady Jane Grey’s party never had the smallest chance: she
    herself might have been allowed to be at liberty with no danger to the
    Queen, while to execute her boy-husband was as barbarous and useless
    as to execute herself. Fifty persons, however, officers, knights, and
    gentlemen, were put to death in consequence of the Rebellion. Four
    hundred common men were hanged about London. Fifty were hanged on
    gibbets, and there left to hang a great part of the summer.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">ST. PETER AD VINCULA, OVERLOOKING TOWER GREEN<br />
      E. Gardner’s Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Meantime, the people of London—partly exasperated by the sight of
    these gibbets; partly hating the Spanish marriage; partly hating the
    break-up of the Reformation—showed their minds in every possible way.
    They shot at preachers of Papistry; they dressed up a cat like a Roman
    Priest, and hanged it on a gallows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> in Cheapside; they found a girl
    who pretended to receive messages from a spirit. It was called the
    Spirit in the Wall. When the Eucharist was carried through Smithfield
    a man tried to knock the holy elements out of the priest’s hands. And
    on Easter Day a priest saying mass in St. Margaret’s, Westminster, was
    attacked by a man with a knife.</p>

  <p>The Marian Persecution began in January 1555. The Queen issued a
    proclamation that bonfires should be lit in various places in the City
    to show the people’s joy and gladness for the abolition of heresies.
    This was the signal for the martyrdoms. John Rogers, Prebendary of
    St. Paul’s, was burned, to begin with, at Smithfield; Hooper, at
    Gloucester; Ferrar at St. David’s; Rowland Taylor at Hadleigh; Lawrence
    Saunders at Coventry; William Flower at Westminster; John Cardmaker at
    Smithfield; John Bradford at Smithfield. It is enough to state that
    the martyrs of this Persecution were two hundred and eighty-eight in
    number: including five Bishops, twenty-one clergy, fifty-five women,
    four children, and two hundred and three laymen. Of the laymen, only
    eight were gentlemen. I will invite consideration of this fact later on.</p>

  <p>The flames of martyrdom lasted till within a month of Mary’s end. It is
    difficult to understand how the Bishops could believe that the burning
    of this kind of heretic stamped out heresy. Hundreds, nay, thousands,
    of families went in perpetual mourning for the death of brother or
    cousin, a martyr faithful to the end. The Bishops might have understood
    the signs of the times: they might have seen the Mayor and Aldermen
    trying vainly to show conviction rather than obedience in attending
    all the processions and functions of the Church at which the people
    looked on sullenly and with murmurs; they might have listened to the
    wisdom of Cardinal Pole, who pointed out to the Queen and the Council
    that these severities were destructive to the Catholic Faith in the
    country. The Persecution reads like the revenge of a revengeful woman.
    “Burn! Burn! Burn!” she cries. “To avenge the tears of my mother; to
    avenge the unhappiness of my childhood; to avenge the act that made me
    illegitimate; to avenge the marriage of Anne Boleyn. Burn! Burn! Burn!”</p>

  <p>Everybody knows the eager hopes and expectation with which Mary looked
    forward to the birth of a child. The tales of the common people about
    the Queen’s supposed pregnancy are illustrated by a story in Holinshed.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“There came to see me, whome I did both heare and see, one Isabel
      Malt, a woman dwelling in Aldersgate Street in Horne allie, not
      farre from the house where this present book was printed, who
      before witnesse made this declaration unto us, that she being
      delivered of a man-child upon Whitsuntide in the morning, which was
      the eleventh daie of June Anno 1555, there came to hir the Lord
      North, and another lord to her unknowne, dwelling then about old
      Fish Street, demanding of hir if she would part with hir child, and
      would swear that she never knew nor had no such child. Which if
      she would, hir sonne (they said) should be well provided for, she
      should take no care for it, with manie faire offers if she would
      part with the child. After that came other women also, of whome one
      (she said) should have been the rocker:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> but she in no wise would
      let go hir sonne, who at the writing hereof, being alive and called
      Timothie Malt, was of the age of thirteene yeares and upward. Thus
      much (I saie) I heard of the woman hirself. What credit is to be
      given to hir relation, I deale not withall, but leave it to the
      libertie of the reader to believe it they that list: to them that
      list not, I have no further warrant to assure them.” (Vol. iv. p.
      83.)</p>

  <p>The same Chronicler gives us a glimpse of the divided state of
    the popular mind on the occasion of the removal of Dr. Sands,
    Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, to London, to be tried for heresy. As he
    left Cambridge the Papists came out to jeer at him, and his friends
    to mourn for him. When he got to London, one like a milk-wife hurled
    a stone at him, which struck him in the breast. When he came to Tower
    Hill a woman cried out, “Fie on thee, thou knave, thou traitor, thou
    heretic!” For which she was upbraided by another woman who called out,
    “Good gentleman: God be thy comfort and give thee strength to stand in
    God’s cause even to the end!” When, after some weeks, they brought him
    from the Tower to the Marshalsea the people had gone round already, and
    “poperie was unsaverie.” Everywhere they prayed to God to comfort him
    and to strengthen him in the truth. In the Marshalsea, Sands fell into
    the hands of a Protestant keeper, who gave him all the indulgence he
    could. And in the end he escaped into Holland, and there stayed till
    the death of Mary.</p>

  <p>The examples of Henry the Seventh’s reign were not likely to be lost so
    soon. A lad of eighteen named William Fetherstone, a miller’s son, was
    reported to be at Eltham in Kent giving himself out for King Edward,
    who, he declared, was not dead at all. Was the boy mad? It is not
    known. He himself declared that he had been made to say this: it is
    quite possible that certain hot-headed Protestants thought to set up
    King Edward again, and so to get back the new religion. Such a thing
    can never be attempted without encouragement—perhaps the lad was soft
    and easily moulded. Being brought before the Council he rambled in his
    talk; wherefore he was committed to the Marshalsea as a lunatic. That
    conclusion did not prevent them from whipping the boy all round the
    Palace at Westminster and all the way from Westminster to Smithfield.
    They then packed him off to his birthplace in the North, where he might
    have rested in peace; but the unlucky wretch began to talk again about
    Edward VI., who, he said, was still alive. Therefore they brought him
    up to London and hanged him at Tyburn.</p>

  <p>To return to the other points connected with London during this reign.
    They are not many. One of the difficulties was the rush into London of
    Spaniards who came over after the marriage of Philip and Mary. It is
    interesting to note how with every consort of foreign origin the people
    of the country to which he or she belonged flocked over to London in
    multitudes. After the Norman Conquest came troops of Normans; after the
    accession of Henry II. came Angevins; after the arrival of Eleanor of
    Provence came men of Provence; and now came Spaniards. Was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>London,
    then, always considered a Promised Land to those who lived outside?
    It was but a poor Land of Promise in these years, when all the world
    was torn by civil and religious wars. However, the Spaniards were
    everywhere: “a man should have mete in the streets for one Englishman
    above iiij Spanyardes”; the Court was crammed with Spaniards; and
    Philip, so far from attempting to win the hearts of the English nobles,
    held himself aloof with Castilian ceremony. We hear little more of
    the Spaniards after Philip’s departure: probably they found London an
    unfavourable soil for a permanent settlement and withdrew; the Spanish
    element as shown in the names of the Londoners at the present day, or
    in the Parish Registers, is small indeed.</p>

      E. Gardner’s Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The jealousy of foreigners, especially of Spaniards, caused trouble in
    the City throughout this reign. There were rumours that thousands of
    Spaniards were coming over; the old jealousy of the Hanseatic League
    was renewed: the Mayor gave orders that work should not be given to
    foreigners; they were forbidden to open shops in the City; they were
    not allowed to keep school; their shutters were forcibly closed. One
    feels that the situation of the foreigner in the City was anything but
    pleasant, especially if he were a Spaniard.</p>

  <p>The submission of Juries to the Judges was expected in matters of
    treason, if not in other things. The case of Nicholas Throgmorton,
    charged with high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> treason and complicity in the Rebellion of Wyatt,
    proves this. Doubtless it was in opposition to the Judge’s charge
    that the Jury brought in a verdict of Not Guilty. For this they were
    summoned before the Star Chamber, where four of the twelve made
    submission; the remaining eight were sent to prison, where they
    remained for six months. They were then brought before the Star Chamber
    again, where they defended their finding as being in accordance with
    their own consciences. As if Juries in matters of treason could have
    consciences! So they were sent back to prison, and only got out by
    paying a fine—some of £44, some of £60 apiece.</p>

  <p>In 1556 the City gave Mary a loan of £6000.</p>

  <p>War with France was declared in June 1557. The City was instructed
    to put its munitions of war on a sound and serviceable footing.
    It complied, and raised a force of 500 men, which joined the army
    commanded by Lord Pembroke. In less than a month the Queen sent a
    letter to the Mayor informing him of the departure of Philip and
    commanding him to raise another force of 1000 men. After a good deal
    of protest and grumbling, and after vain appeals to the liberties and
    franchises of the City respecting the sending of men on active service,
    submission was made and the men were got together. This was early in
    August. But it does not seem that they were sent. On 27th August the
    French were defeated at St. Quentin. Towards the end of the year it was
    known that Calais was in a dangerous position. On 2nd January a message
    arrived from the Queen, ordering the despatch of 500 men at once. They
    were wanted for the relief of Calais. But Calais fell on the 7th. Then
    the City was called upon to furnish another 2000 men. On the 13th the
    Queen wrote to say that a violent storm had crippled her fleet—the men
    were to be kept back, but in readiness. Then it was heard that Philip’s
    forces were on their way to Flanders, under the Duke of Savoy, and that
    the Channel was kept open by a Spanish fleet. A regiment of 500 was
    therefore sent off to Dover in order to be shipped for Dunkirk.</p>

  <p>In March 1558 Mary raised a loan of £20,000 on the security of the
    Crown lands, from the City Companies. The greater Companies contributed
    £16,983:6:3, the rest being made up by the smaller Companies. The
    Mercers gave £3275; the smaller Companies sums varying from £50 to £300.</p>

  <p>For the better regulation of trade an Act of Parliament was passed in
    1554 by which non-residents were not allowed to sell their wares in any
    town.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Whereas the Cities, Boroughs, Towns Corporate and Market Towns,
      did heretofore flourish, where Youth were well educated, and
      civilly brought up, and were highly serviceable to the Government;
      but were brought to great Decay, and were like to come to utter
      Ruin and Destruction, by Reason that Persons dwelling out of the
      said Cities and Towns came and took away the Relief and Subsistence
      of the said Cities and Towns by selling their Wares there: For
      Remedy whereof, be it enacted, That no Person or Persons dwelling
      any where out of the said Cities or Towns (the Liberties of the two
      Universities only excepted) shall hereafter sell, or cause to be
      sold, by Retail, any Woollen and Linnen Cloth (except of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
      own making), or any Haberdashery, Grocery, or Mercery Ware, at
      or within any of the said Cities, Boroughs, Towns Corporate, or
      Market Towns within this Realm (except in open Fairs), on Pain to
      forfeit and lose, for every Time so offending, six shillings and
      eight Pence, and the whole Wares so sold, offered or profered to be
      sold.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 251.)</p>

  <p>An attempt was made to reduce the number of Taverns in London and
    Westminster. There were to be no more than forty in the City and three
    in Westminster. But the law was not enforced nor obeyed.</p>

  <p>In this reign we first hear of the abuse of prisons. One of the two
    Compters then stood in Bread Street. The warden or keeper, one Richard
    Husbands, was accused of maltreating his prisoners barbarously; also
    of receiving men and women of criminal and disreputable character,
    and giving them lodging within the prison for fourpence a night. The
    Corporation therefore built a larger and more convenient compter in
    Wood Street, to which they removed the prisoners, appointing a new
    keeper in place of Husbands.</p>

  <p>In January 1557 one Christopher Draper, Alderman of Cordwainer Street
    Ward, employed a man to walk nightly about the streets of the Ward,
    ringing a bell and calling on the people to take care of their fires
    and lights; to help the poor; and to pray for the dead. This was the
    origin of the office of Bellman.</p>

  <p>In this year arrived the first Ambassador from Russia. He was wrecked
    on the coast of Scotland. The Russia Company sent officers into Holland
    with money and necessaries, and with orders to bring him to London.
    On his arrival he was met by eighty merchants on horseback, richly
    accoutred and with gold chains round their necks, and was taken to a
    house in Highgate, where he was royally entertained for the night.
    Next day he rode into the City and was received by the Mayor and Lord
    Montague, who escorted him to his quarters in Fenchurch Street. During
    the whole of his stay his charges were defrayed by the Russia Company.</p>

  <p>The profuse expenditure expected of the Mayor and Sheriffs during their
    year of office, made many citizens who ought to have filled these
    posts, retire into the country rather than put themselves to such great
    expense.</p>

  <p>The Common Council took up the matter: in a very curious array of
    ordinances it was provided among other things</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That thenceforth the Mayor should have no more than one course
      either at Dinner or Supper; and that on a Festival, being a Flesh
      Day, to consist of no more than seven Dishes, whether hot or cold;
      and on every Festival, being a Fish Day, eight Dishes; and on every
      common Flesh Day, six Dishes; and on every common Fish Day, seven
      Dishes, exclusive of Brawn, Collops with Eggs, Sallads, Pottage,
      Butter, Cheese, Eggs, Herrings, Sprats and Shrimps, together with
      all sorts of Shell-fish and Fruits: That the Aldermen and Sheriffs
      should have one Dish less than the above-mentioned; and all the
      City Companies at their several Entertainments the same number of
      Dishes as the Aldermen and Sheriffs; but with this Restriction, to
      have neither Swan, Crane, nor Bustard, upon the Penalty of forty
      Shillings; etc. etc. etc.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the 17th of November 1558 Mary died. The bonfires which hailed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
    accession of her sister were fires of rejoicing over the death of the
    unhappy Queen. The whole City was united in joy, with the exception of
    the Bishops and the Priests. Not only was religion concerned, but the
    domination of Spain; the immigration of Spaniards; the humiliation of
    the country. The general rejoicing was marked by the keeping the day
    of Elizabeth’s accession as a holiday for a hundred and fifty years to
    come.</p>

      From a painting, attributed to Zuccaro, in the National Portrait

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">My</span> Lady Elizabeth,” the Venetian Ambassador writes in the lifetime
    of Queen Mary, “the daughter of Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn, was
    born in 1533 (in the month of September—so that she is at present
    twenty-three years of age). She is a lady of great elegance both of
    body and mind, although her face may be called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> rather pleasing than
    beautiful; she is tall and well made; her complexion fine though rather
    sallow; her eyes, but, above all, her hands, which she takes care not
    to conceal, are of superior beauty. In her knowledge of the Greek and
    Italian languages she surpasses the Queen. She excels the Queen in the
    knowledge of languages; for, in addition to Latin, she has acquired no
    small acquaintance with Greek. She speaks Italian, which the Queen does
    not. In this language she takes such delight, that in the presence of
    Italians it is her ambition not to converse in any other. Her spirits
    and understanding are admirable, as she has proved by her conduct in
    the midst of suspicion and danger, when she concealed her religion and
    comported herself like a good Catholic. She is proud and dignified
    in her manners; for, though her mother’s condition is well-known to
    her, she is also aware that this mother of hers was united to the King
    in wedlock, with the sanction of the Holy Church and the concurrence
    of the Primate of the realm; and though misled with regard to her
    religion, she is conscious of having acted with good faith; nor can
    this latter circumstance reflect upon her birth, since she was born in
    the same faith as that professed by the Queen. Her father’s affection
    she shared at least in equal measure with her sister; it is said
    that she resembles her father more than the Queen does, and the King
    considered them equally in his will, settling on both of them 10,000
    <i>scudi</i> per annum. Yet with this allowance she is always in debt.
    And she would be much more so if she did not studiously abstain from
    enlarging her establishment, and so giving greater offence to the
    Queen. For indeed there is not a knight or a gentleman in the kingdom
    who has not sought her service, either for himself or for some son or
    brother; such is the affection and love that she commands. This is one
    reason why her expenses are increased. She always alleges her poverty
    as an excuse to those who wish to enter her service, and by this means
    she has cleverly contrived to excite compassion, and at the same time a
    greater affection; because there is no one to whom it does not appear
    strange that she—the daughter of a king—should be treated in so
    miserable a manner. She is allowed to live in one of her houses about
    twelve miles distant from London, but she is surrounded by a number of
    guards and spies, who watch her narrowly and report every movement to
    the Queen. Moreover, the Queen, though she hates her most sincerely,
    yet treats her in public with every outward sign of affection and
    regard, and never converses with her but on pleasing and agreeable
    subjects. She has also contrived to ingratiate herself with the King of
    Spain, through whose influence the Queen is prevented from bastardising
    her, as she certainly has it in her power to do by means of an Act of
    Parliament, which would exclude her from the throne. It is believed
    that but for this interference of the King, the Queen would without
    more remorse chastise her in the severest manner; for whatever plots
    against the Queen are discovered, my Lady Elizabeth or some of her
    people may always be sure to be mentioned among the persons concerned
    in them.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>Attention has already been called to the rejoicings of the people on
    the death of Mary and the uplifting of that long-continued cloud. The
    bells of the City were rung; bonfires were lit; loaded tables open for
    all comers were spread in the streets—yea, even in that dark night of
    November. A week later the new Queen rode from Hatfield to the Charter
    House, where she stayed for five days; on the 28th she rode in state
    to the Tower; here she remained till the 5th of December, when she
    went by water to Somerset House. On the 17th of December, the body of
    Mary was laid in Westminster Abbey, with the Roman Catholic Service;
    on the 12th of January, the Queen returned to the Tower, and thence
    on the following day she rode to Westminster. The reader has probably
    remarked, in the course of this history, that neither King nor Queen,
    nor Mayor nor people, ever paid the slightest regard for weather or for
    season. A Royal Riding with Pageants and red cloth and tapestry, and a
    procession in boats, was undertaken as readily in January, when there
    is generally hard frost; in April, when there is generally east wind;
    in July, when there is generally the heat of summer; or in October,
    when there is generally fine weather with the repose of autumn. Season
    and weather, sunshine or frost, made no difference. In her desire to
    win the hearts of the people, Elizabeth probably paid no heed to the
    weather, whether it was cold or not.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>We have remarked a great change in the temper and attitude of the City
    towards the Sovereign. We hear from time to time murmurings about the
    City liberties; but nothing of importance. The reasons are several:
    the Tudor sovereigns carefully respected those liberties which, so
    to speak, made the most show; they abstained from interference with
    the City elections; they would not interfere with the City Courts. As
    regards the point of real importance to themselves—the raising of
    money and men—their demands were generally arbitrary; witness the
    calls of Mary for men and still more men. Another cause for cheerful
    loyalty was that when the religious discussions were at length
    appeased, it was incumbent on everybody to do his utmost for the
    Protestant Cause, which became the National Cause. For these reasons we
    find the City cheerfully giving to Elizabeth what it reluctantly gave,
    or refused to give, to Henry the Third or Richard the Second.</p>

  <p>It was understood by those who welcomed the Queen so joyously that
    her first care must be the restoration of the Reformed Faith. Every
    craftsman who threw up his cap expected so much. Fortunately, the
    events of the last reign had turned the hearts of most people wholly
    away from the mass. Elizabeth was fully informed as to the opinion of
    the majority of her subjects; as for her own opinion, it is said that
    she favoured the old Church. Perhaps so; that is to say, she would
    rather, as a matter of choice, listen to the Roman Mass than to the
    English Litany—it is certainly more beautiful; at the same time, one
    cannot but believe that she was sincere in making her choice and in
    keeping steadfast to it. Her kindness to the Catholic Faith was shown
    in the relaxation of persecution. She would not at first persecute any
    for believing what she herself publicly professed not to believe. Her
    first step, however, clearly showed the direction of future law. She
    put forth a royal proclamation ordering the cessation of disputations
    and sermons, and ordered in their place the reading of the Epistle
    and Gospel for the Day, with the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar
    tongue. She also appointed, in the first year of her reign, certain
    Commissioners, whose duty it was to visit every diocese, for the
    establishment of religion according to the new Act of Parliament. Those
    for London were Sir Richard Sackville, knight; Robert Horne, Doctor of
    Divinity; Doctor Huicke; and Master Savage. The Commissioners visited
    every parish, calling before them persons of every sort, whom they
    instructed and admonished. They suppressed all the Religious Houses
    that Mary had established—the Abbey of Westminster, Syon House, the
    House of Shene, the Black Friars of Smithfield and those of Greenwich.
    They further pulled down all the new roods and images, and burned all
    the vestments, altar cloths, banners, mass books, and rood lofts. In
    fact, the people showed very plainly that their minds were all for the
    Protestant religion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>An Act of Uniformity followed, which forbade the use of any form of
    public prayer other than that of the Prayer Book of Edward VI. with one
    or two slight alterations. This book was replaced in the churches, and
    service was conducted in accordance with it on Whit Sunday 1559. What
    happened immediately after? A pulling out of Bibles from hiding-places;
    a return to the old talk, restrained for five years for fear of
    informers; an enjoyable plunge into the anti-Scriptural aspects of the
    Roman Creed; and a rush for the ornaments, roods, tombs, the vestments
    and the incense vessels and the candles in all the City churches. In
    some cases the wafers, vestments, and altar cloths, books, banners,
    and other ornaments of the churches were burned—things which had cost
    thousands when they were renewed under Queen Mary. All this happened,
    and an incredible amount of mischief was done before the destruction
    was stopped.</p>

  <p>There appears to have been little strength of feeling or spirit of
    martyrdom among the Roman Catholics in London. They submitted; more
    than this, they made no attempt to maintain their religion; their
    children, if not themselves, became wholly Anglican; such Roman
    Catholic worship as survived lurked in holes and corners, or was
    maintained secretly by a few nobles and gentlemen. Before long,
    however, the Government had to deal with that advanced form of
    Protestantism which had been brought over from the Continent. In 1565
    an order was issued that all the clergy were to wear the surplice.
    A good number of them refused, and left their churches, with their
    congregations. This was the beginning of Nonconformity. But Elizabeth
    made no attempt to enforce obedience or to persecute those who
    dissented.</p>

  <p>On the 25th of May 1570, the temper of the people was plainly indicated
    by their reception of a Bull from the Pope, which was actually
    found nailed to the door of the Bishop of London’s Palace in Paul’s
    Churchyard. It was in Latin. Holinshed gives both text and translation.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Pius, Bishop, servant of God’s servants, etc. Queene Elizabeth
      hath cleane put awaie the sacrifice of the masse, praiers,

      (vol. iv. p. 253).</p>

  <p>The crime was brought home to one John Felton, who on 4th August,
    three months later, was arraigned at the Guildhall on the charge of
    affixing the said Bull. Four days later he was drawn from Newgate to
    St. Paul’s Churchyard and there duly hanged, cut down alive, bowelled,
    and quartered. On the same day—which shows that their office was not
    an easy one—the Sheriffs of London, after seeing the end of Felton,
    had to accompany two young men, who had been found guilty of coining,
    to Tyburn, where they suffered the same horrible punishment.</p>

  <p>Meantime the Catholic enemy never relaxed his attempt to effect the
    reconversion, or, failing that, the subjugation, of this country. Not
    by Bulls alone did he work. Seminary priests were sent over to work
    secretly upon the people and so, it was hoped, gradually to make them
    ready for conversion. After the tender mercies of the last reign one
    would believe that the task was hopeless: one is persuaded that even
    if the secret missionaries had been allowed to put an advertisement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
    in the windows openly proclaiming their object they could have done no
    harm. But the Queen’s Council, whether wisely or not, were extremely
    jealous of these priests. They charged the City Authorities to try
    every means of laying hands on them: they were to arrest all persons
    who did not attend church; and to banish all strangers who did not go
    to church; they were to make every stranger subscribe the Articles.
    A proclamation was issued ordering English parents to remove their
    children from foreign colleges; declaring that to harbour Jesuit
    priests was to harbour rebels; imposing a fine upon those who did not
    attend church; which involved a strict watch upon all the parishes to
    find out what persons kept away. The two chief conspirators moving
    about England were two priests, named Campion and Parsons. Campion was
    presently arrested and, after undergoing torture, was executed in the
    usual manner. Parsons got back to the Continent, where he continued in
    his machinations. Catholic historians are eloquent on the sufferings of
    the Catholics during this reign; we must, however, acknowledge that the
    conspiracies and intrigues of such men as Campion, Allen, and Parsons
    went far to explain the persecution to which they were liable.</p>

  <p>The failure of the Armada: the failure of Philip’s second attempt,
    destroyed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> tempest; the fact that the Catholic cause was now in
    the minds of the people the Spanish cause, and therefore execrable;
    the manifest proofs that the heart of the nation was sound for the
    Queen and the Protestant religion;—did not put a stop to Catholic
    spies and Catholic conspirators. The emissaries are always called
    “Spanish,” though they were generally English by birth; it is probable
    that Cardinal Allen found the emissaries, whose work Philip certainly
    did not discourage. These emissaries were ecclesiastics, who came
    over-disguised in every possible way. Those who were young called
    themselves, or became, students at Oxford and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> Cambridge; those who
    were older rode about the country disguised as simple gentlemen,
    merchants, physicians; they worked secretly, everywhere with the
    design of sapping the loyalty of the people towards the Queen and the
    Protestant Faith. They did so at great peril, with the certainty of
    tortures if they were caught; and their courage in facing the dangers
    was so great that it elevates their conspiracies into the propaganda of
    a sacred cause. The greatest exertions were made for their detection,
    and chief among these was the means already mentioned of noting those
    who did not go to church. However, it does not appear that many were
    caught, and perhaps the numbers were exaggerated. Sharpe has found a
    description of one whom they desired to arrest in 1596 (i. 550):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“A yonge man of meane and slender stature, aged about xxvj, with a
      high collored face, red nose, a warte over his left eye, havinge
      two greate teeth before, standinge out very apparant, he nameth
      himselffe Edward Harrison, borne in Westmerland; apparelled in
      a crane collored fustian dublet, rounde hose, after the frenche
      facion, an olde paire of yollowe knit neather stockes, he escaped
      without either cloake, girdle, garters or shoes.”</p>

  <p>The constant discussion of religious matters and agitation on points of
    Faith produced the natural phenomenon of religious enthusiasts, strange
    sects, and mad beliefs.</p>

  <p>The growth of the Puritan spirit is shown by a letter written by the
    Lord Mayor on the 14th of January 1583. A large number of people
    were assembled one Sunday for Sport, <i>i.e.</i> Bear-baiting, in Paris
    Gardens; they were standing round the pit on twelve scaffolds, when the
    scaffolds all fell down at once, so that many were killed and wounded.
    The Mayor wrote as follows to the Lord Treasurer:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That it gave great occasion to acknowledge the hand of God, for
      such abuse of his Sabbath-day; and moved him in Conscience to
      beseech his Lordship to give Order for Redress of such Contempt
      of God’s service. And that he had for that end treated with some
      Justices of Peace of that County, who shewed themselves to have
      very good Zeal, but alledged Want of Commission; which they humbly
      referred to his honourable Wisdom.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 267.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After Religion, Charity. The bequests to religious purposes had become
    fewer and of smaller importance during the fifteenth century: they
    were almost discontinued in the reign of Henry VII.; they ceased under
    Henry VIII. and his son; and they hardly revived during the reign
    of Mary. There can be no surer indication of the change of thought.
    Under Elizabeth we have not only a complete change of thought but the
    commencement of a new era in Charity. We now enter upon the period of
    Endowed Charities. Not that they were before unknown, but that they
    were grafted upon and formed part of Religious Endowments, as St.
    Anthony’s School, which belonged to the Religious House of that name,
    and Whittington’s Bedesmen, who formed part of Whittington’s College.
    The Religious element now disappears except for the erection of a
    chapel for the Bedesmen. The list of Charitable Endowments founded in
    this century is large and very laudable. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> consist of colleges,
    schools, and almshouses, not in London only, but by London citizens for
    their native places, for Oxford, and for Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Of London as a City of Soldiers we hear much less under Elizabeth,
    despite the contingent sent to fight the Spanish invader, than under
    any king. London no longer sallies forth ten thousand strong for this
    claimant or that. She finds, however, the money for ships, and on
    occasion she raises and equips for foreign service, 400 men, 600 men,
    1000 men, at the order of the Queen.</p>

  <p>The first appearance of Londoners under arms was a mere parade, to
    which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> City sent 1400 men. They were equipped by the twelve
    principal Companies, who also supplied officers from their own body.
    In 1562 the Queen asked the City for a force of 600 men. These were
    raised. Next year she applied again for 1000 men for the holding of
    Havre; only 400, however, were wanted. These sailed for Havre, but the
    garrison being attacked by the plague there was no fighting, and the
    town surrendered.</p>

  <p>In 1572 the Queen in a letter to the Mayor commanded him to raise a
    large body of men, young and strong, for instruction in the Military
    Arts. Accordingly the Companies chose young men to the number of 3000;
    armed them; placed officers of experience over them, and instructed
    them. This appears to have been the beginning of the London Trained
    Bands. In May of the same year they were reviewed by the Queen. In
    1574 the City was called upon to furnish 400 soldiers for the Queen’s
    service.</p>

  <p>In 1578 the City was ordered to provide 2000 arquebusiers. Scarcely
    had the order been received when there came another for 2000 men to be
    raised and kept in readiness.</p>

  <p>On the 8th March 1587, the Queen sent a letter, followed by one from
    the Privy Council, to the same effect, informing the Mayor that certain
    intelligence had been received of warlike preparations being made in
    foreign parts, and calling upon the City to provide a force of 10,000
    men fully armed and equipped, of whom 6000 were to be enrolled under
    Captains and Ensigns and to be trained at times convenient.</p>

  <p>The men were raised in the following numbers from each ward:—</p>

  <p>We may apply this total in order to make a guess at the population
    of London in 1587. Thus supposing <i>x</i> to be the percentage of the
    population taken from each ward to fill the ranks, since the population
    of each ward = the number taken, multiplied by 100, and divided by <i>x</i>,</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

  <p>Therefore the whole population of the City</p>

  = 1,000,700 ÷ <i>x</i>

  <p>The City also supplied a fleet of sixteen ships, the largest in the
    river, fully found, with four light pinnaces, and paid the men during
    their services. It was with these ships that Drake ran into Cadiz and
    Lisbon, destroyed a great quantity of shipping, and threw into the sea
    the military materials that had been accumulated there.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Leicester, who was in command at Tilbury, received 1000 of
    the London force only, and that on condition that they brought their
    own provisions.</p>

  <p>The London men wore a uniform of white with white caps, and the City
    arms in scarlet on back and front. Some carried arquebuses; some were
    halberdiers; some were pikemen. They marched in companies according to
    their arms. Their officers rode beside the men dressed in black velvet.
    They were preceded by billmen, corresponding to the modern pioneers; by
    a company of whifflers, i.e. trumpeters; and in the midst marched six
    Ensigns in white satin faced with black sarsenet, and rich scarves. The
    dress of officers and men was just as useless and unfit for continued
    work as could well be devised. It is melancholy to find that the Earl
    of Leicester, who was in command at Tilbury, held a very poor opinion
    of the London contingent. “I see,” he writes to Walsingham, “that their
    service will be little, except they have their own captains, and having
    them I look for none at all by them when we shall meet the enemy.”
    Most fortunately there was no enemy to meet, and the heroism of the
    Londoners remains unchallenged. The Captain of the London Trained Bands
    was Martin Bond, citizen, whose tomb remains at St. Helen’s Church.</p>

  <p>When the danger was over, the Aldermen looked to it that the price of
    provisions should not be raised when the sick and wounded were brought
    home. But it was some time before the welcome news was received of the
    final dispersion of the invading fleet. The first public notification
    was made in a sermon preached at Paul’s Cross by the Dean of St.
    Paul’s, in the presence of the Mayor and Aldermen and the Livery
    Companies in their best gowns.</p>

  <p>On the 18th November the Queen rode into the City in state and attended
    a Thanksgiving Service.</p>

  <p>Sharpe calls attention to the fact that two at least of the great naval
    commanders were well-known in the City:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Both Frobisher and Hawkins owned property in the City, and in all
      probability resided there, like their fellow-seaman and explorer,
      Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who was living in Red Cross Street, in the
      parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, in 1583, the year that he met
      his death at sea. The same parish claims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> Frobisher, whose remains
      (excepting his entrails, which were interred at Plymouth, where
      he died) lie buried in St. Giles’s Church, and to whom a mural
      monument was erected by the Vestry in 1888, just three centuries
      after the defeat of the Armada, to which he had contributed so
      much. If Hawkins himself did not reside in the City, his widow had
      a mansion house in Mincing Lane. He, too, had probably lived there;
      for although he died and was buried at sea, a monument was erected
      to his memory and to that of Katherine, his first wife, in the
      church of St. Dunstan-in-the-East. There is one other—a citizen of
      London and son of an alderman—whose name has been handed down as
      having taken an active part in the defence of the kingdom at this
      time, not at sea, but on land. A monument in the recently restored
      church of St. Helen, Bishopsgate, tells us that Martin Bond, son of
      Alderman William Bond, ‘was captaine in ye yeare 1588 at ye campe
      at Tilbury, and after remained chief captaine of ye trained bands
      of this Citty until his death.’ The monument represents him as
      sitting in a tent guarded by two sentinels, with a page holding a
      horse.” (Sharpe, vol. i. pp. 544–545.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1591 a further contingent of 400 men was ordered. In 1594 the
    City was called upon to raise 450 men. In 1596 a message came to the
    Mayor and Aldermen from the Queen. They were listening to a sermon
    at Paul’s Cross. The letter commanded them to raise a thousand men
    immediately. They rose and left the sermon, and instantly set to work.
    Before eight of the clock they had raised their men. But the order
    was countermanded, and the men were disbanded. On Easter Day in the
    morning another message came to the same effect, and then—it is a
    curious story—the Mayor and Aldermen went round to the churches in
    the respective wards. Remember that on such a day every man in the
    City would be in church. The Mayor shut the doors, picked his men,
    and before noon had raised his thousand men. This order also was
    countermanded, and the men returned home. A strange interruption of an
    Easter morning’s service!</p>

  <p>In the same year the Queen asked for more men. Then the City Common
    Council expostulated. On the sea service alone, they pointed out, the
    City had spent 10,000 marks within the last few years. In 1597 they
    raised first 500 men, then 300 more, and sent the Queen £60,000 on
    mortgage. In 1598, on a new alarm of another Spanish invasion, the City
    found sixteen ships and a force of 6000 men.</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that during this reign the City furnished over
    6000 fully equipped soldiers for active service; that it raised at
    an hour’s notice, on two separate occasions, 1000 men ready for
    immediate service; that it raised a force of Trained Bands 3000
    strong; that on occasion it could increase this number to 10,000;
    that it could fit out for sea a fleet of twenty or thirty ships.
    I do not think that the expenditure of the City on these military
    services has ever been published, but it must have been very great.
    A corresponding expenditure at the present time would be enormous;
    it would be expressed in many millions. This simple fact both proves
    and illustrates the tried loyalty of the City. The time, however, had
    gone by when the Londoners could, and did, send out an army capable
    of deposing one king and setting up another. That power and that
    spirit died with the accession of the Tudors. In the beginning of
    Elizabeth’s reign the citizens even prayed to be excused the practice
    of arms even as a volunteer force, seeing that “the most parte of
    those our apprentices and handy craftesmen who continually are kept at
    work; who also, if they should have that libertie to be trayned and
    drawn from their workes in these matters, wolde thereby fall into such
    idleness and insolency that many would never be reduced agayne into any
    good order or service.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>We have seen repeated proofs that the City was never friendly towards
    foreigners. At this time there were many causes beside the old trade
    jealousy why the people should view strangers with an unfriendly eye.
    During the last reign the City swarmed with Spaniards; from the very
    first day of this long reign until the very last, Spain never ceased
    plotting, conspiring, and carrying on war with the Queen and the new
    Religion. In the foreign merchants’ houses the conspirators found a
    refuge. There were, again, thousands of immigrants from Flanders or
    Spain, flying from religious persecution; and though many of the people
    settled down to steady industry, there were many who were by no means
    the virtuous, law-abiding persons, such as the present age would expect
    of Huguenots.</p>

  <p>From time to time, partly in order to allay the jealousy and terror
    of the people, partly for the sake of getting at the facts, there was
    a numbering of the strangers. Thus, in 1567, such a numbering showed
    45 Scots; 428 French; 45 Spaniards and Portuguese; 140 Italians;
    2030 Dutch; 44 Burgundians; two Danes; and one Liégeois: in all 2735
    persons. In 1580 another census of aliens was taken; wherein it was
    shown that there were 2302 Dutch; 1838 French; 116 Italians; 1542
    English born of foreign parents; of other nations not specified
    447; and of persons not certified 217: in all 6462. In 1593 a third
    census showed 5259 strangers in London. These figures are not without
    interest. In the first year we find a large number of Dutch; they are
    fugitives. In the next we find that the whole number of strangers has
    more than doubled: there has been a large accession of Huguenots; in
    the third census the numbers have gone down a little. In our time a
    great outcry has been raised over the invasion of the Town by 50,000
    Polish Jews; that means a proportion of one in a hundred. In 1560 there
    were 6500 for a population of, say, 120,000, which means one in twenty
    (approximately). Now, one in twenty is a large fraction out of the
    general population.</p>

  <p>At one time the hatred of the Apprentices grew so irrepressible that a
    conspiracy like that of Evil May Day was formed among the Apprentices,
    with the design of murdering all the foreigners. The conspiracy was
    happily discovered, and the conspirators laid by the heels in Newgate.

    <div class="caption">WILLIAM CECIL, FIRST BARON BURGHLEY (1520–1598)<br />
      From the painting by Marc Gheeraedts (?) in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The domestic history of Elizabeth’s reign is crammed full of hangings,
    burnings, and the executions of traitors, with all the barbarity
    of that punishment. There are so many, that in order to make this
    remarkable shedding of blood intelligible, I have compiled a list of
    the executions mentioned by Holinshed and Stow during one part of her
    reign. The list will be found in <a href="#APPENDIX_X">Appendix X.</a>, (Executions, 1563–1586).
    This list, which principally concerns London and is apparently
    incomplete, even within its narrow limits shows that between the years
    1563 and 1586, there were in all 64 executions at which 228 persons
    suffered. Of these, seventy-one were rebels hanged on two occasions;
    seventeen were executed for murder; three for military offences;
    twelve for counterfeiting, clipping, or debasing the coinage; two for
    counterfeiting the Queen’s signature; twenty-nine were pirates; two
    were executed for witchcraft or conjuring; twelve for robbery; one for
    adultery; three for heresy, and seventy-six for high treason. Among
    the traitors were Dr. John Storey; Edmund Campion; William Parry; the
    Babington conspirators; the Charnock conspirators; and many Roman
    Catholic priests. There can be no doubt that the priests who came over
    with secret designs for the conversion of the country constituted a
    real and ever-present danger; if anything could justify the barbarities
    committed upon them when they were caught these conspiracies were
    enough. That the people at large did not condemn these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> barbarities
    is proved by the fact that there was no feeling of sympathy for the
    sufferers; that the common opinion was that for treason no punishment
    could be too severe; and that the country after Elizabeth’s reign
    was concluded was far more Protestant than at the beginning. The
    conspiracies and secret goings in and out of Catholic priests came to
    an end in the reign of James, for the best of all reasons, viz. that
    there was no one left with whom a priest could conspire or whom he
    could convert. Two women were burned for poisoning their husbands—a
    most dreadful offence, and one which called for the direst terrors
    of the law; one woman was burned for witchcraft; another was only
    hanged for the same offence—but such differences in sentences are
    not unknown at the present day. One more point occurs. Were the last
    dying speeches correctly reported? If so, since they are always so
    moving, and sometimes so eloquent, why did they elicit no response of
    sympathy or indignation among the bystanders? When Thomas Appletree
    was to be hanged for firing a gun accidentally into the Queen’s barge
    (see <a href="#Page_389">p. 389</a>), the people wept, and the culprit wept, but the justice
    of the sentence was not questioned. Now in the Marian Persecution the
    people looked on indignant and sympathetic, being restrained from
    demonstrations by force and fear. Whether the dying speeches are
    correctly reported or invented, matters very little. They show one
    thing, that there was no unmanly terror observed at the last moment:
    every one, guilty or innocent, mounted the ladder with an intrepid
    countenance. Death has no terrors either for the arch-conspirator
    Storey, or for the pirate hanged at Execution Dock.</p>

  <p>The privileges granted to the foreign merchants of the Steelyard and
    the Hanseatic League were finally withdrawn by Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>This withdrawal had been in preparation for nearly two hundred years.
    In the time of Henry IV. English merchants began to trade in the
    Baltic and with Norway and other parts. This aroused the jealousy
    of the Hanseatic League, which seized upon several of the English
    ships. Complaints were laid before the King, who withdrew such of
    the privileges enjoyed by the League as interfered with the carrying
    on of trade by his own merchants. He also granted a charter to the
    merchants trading to the Eastlands. This charter was renewed and
    enlarged by Edward IV. In the first and second of Philip and Mary a
    charter was granted to the Russia Company—we have seen how the first
    Russian Ambassador came to England in the reign of Mary. This Company
    obtained a confirmation of their charter under Queen Elizabeth. Now,
    although our people enjoyed many more privileges than of old, yet the
    Hanseatic League still had the advantage over them by means of their
    well-regulated Societies and their privileges, insomuch that when the
    Queen wanted hemp, pitch, tar, powder, and other munitions of war, she
    had to buy them of the foreign merchants at their own price. The Queen,
    therefore, began to encourage her own people to become merchants: she
    assisted them to form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> companies; she gave them Charters; she withdrew
    all the privileges from the Hansa. Not the least of the debt which
    England owes to this great Queen is her wisdom in the encouragement of
    foreign trade.</p>

  <p>The strange and foolish rising of the Earl of Essex belongs to national
    history. It was, however, met and repressed in the first outbreak by
    the City. Not one person offered to join the Earl; he was proclaimed
    traitor in Cheapside; the Bishop of London raised, in all haste, the
    force which stopped him on Ludgate Hill.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign there were great complaints
    of hawkers and pedlars—in fact we begin to hear of the London Cries.
    These street cries did great harm to London tradesmen. We have seen
    that there were no shops at all originally, except in the appointed
    markets; these hawkers, with their itinerant barrows and baskets,
    brought the market into every part of London. Steps were taken to
    prevent this nuisance; but they were unavailing.</p>

  <p>In 1580 the Queen issued a Proclamation against the building of new
    houses and the further increase of London:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“To the preservation of her People in Health, which may seem
      impossible to continue, though presently, by God’s Goodness, the
      same is perceived to be in better Estate universally than hath
      beene in Man’s Memorie; yet where there are such great Multitudes
      of People brought to inhabite in small Roomes, whereof a great Part
      are seene very poore, yea, such as must live of begging, or by
      worse Means, and they heaped up together, and in a sort smothered
      with many families of Children and Servants in one House or small
      Tenement; it must needes followe, if any Plague or popular Sicknes
      should, by God’s Permission, enter amongst those Multitudes, that
      the same would not only spread itself and invade the whole Citie
      and Confines, but that a great Mortalitie would ensue the same,
      where her Majesties personal Presence is many times required.</p>

    <p>For Remedie whereof, as Time may now serve, until by some further
      good Order be had in Parliament or otherwise, the same may be
      remedied; her Majestie, by good and deliberate advice of her
      Counsell, and being also thereto moved by the considerate opinions
      of the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and other the grave wise men in and
      about the Citie, doth charge and straightly command all manner of
      Persons, of what Qualitie soever they be, to desist and forbeare
      from any new Buildings of any House or Tenement within three miles
      from any of the Gates of the sayde Citie of <i>London</i>, to serve
      for Habitation or Lodging for any Person, where no former House
      hath bene knowen to have bene in the Memorie of such as are now
      living; and also to forbeare from letting or setting, or suffering
      any more Families than one onely to be placed, or to inhabite from
      henceforth in any one House that heretofore hath bene inhabited.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the 6th of December 1586, a very solemn and tragic ceremony was
    performed, first in Cheapside; then in Leadenhall; then at the end of
    London Bridge, and lastly at the south end of Chancery Lane; where
    the Mayor with the Aldermen, and attended by many of the Nobility and
    eighty of the principal citizens in chains of gold, proclaimed the
    sentence of death passed upon the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

  <p>The importance of the act; the publicity given to it; the formalities
    attending the Proclamation,—show the desire of the Queen and her
    Council that the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> should understand the dreadful necessity of
    removing this cause of endless intrigue and conspiracy.</p>

  <p>One more trade regulation closes the history of London in the reign
    of Elizabeth. A practice had grown up among hucksters and others of
    setting up stalls in the streets in front of the shops, in consequence
    of which the trade of the shopkeepers was greatly injured, insomuch
    that many of them were obliged to employ these very people to sell
    their wares for them. It was therefore ordered that no one should
    erect any stall, or stand, before any house under a penalty of twenty
    shillings.</p>

  <p>One of the last things done in the name of the Queen was the offer to
    all Debtors in prison of freedom if they would volunteer to serve on
    board the fleet newly raised for the suppression of Spanish pirates.</p>

  <p>On the death of the Queen, the City, which was always most truly loyal
    and faithful to her, put up in most churches a tablet or a statue to
    her memory.</p>

  <p>This brief and bald account of the relations between the Crown and the
    City is not proffered as a history of London during the Tudor period.
    This history will, it is hoped, be found in the following pages. I
    have only hinted at the creation of the Trading Companies and the
    connection of the great Sea Captains with London. The Poor Law of 1572;
    the granting of monopolies; the wonderful outburst of Literature;
    the troubles caused by the substitution of pasture for agriculture;
    the growth of Puritanism and the beginnings of the High Church,—all
    these things belong to the history of London. The diplomacy; the Court
    intrigues; the rise and fall of Ministers; the anxieties concerning the
    Succession,—these things do not belong to the history of London.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Court of Queen Elizabeth was almost as itinerant as that of Henry
    the Second. The Queen understood thoroughly that for a sovereign to be
    at once loyally served and wholesomely feared it is not enough to sit
    still in one place. She must be seen by her people: they must realise
    by ocular demonstration how great is her power and authority; they must
    learn it by the sight of her person glittering with jewels and all
    glorious with silk and velvet; by the splendour of her train; by the
    noble lords who attend her; by the magnificence of the entertainment
    she receives. Nearly every year of her long reign was marked by one or
    more Progresses; some of her nobles she visited more than once: she was
    the guest of Cecil at Theobalds on twelve different occasions, each
    visit costing the host two or three thousand pounds; three times she
    visited Leicester at Kenilworth. These Progresses, though they belong
    not to the history of London, must be borne in mind in thinking of this
    long and glorious reign.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p>When Elizabeth was not travelling she resided at Whitehall, at St.
    James’s, at Greenwich, at Hampton Court, Windsor, Richmond, Nonsuch,
    Chelsea, Hunsdon. In moving from one palace to another a huge quantity
    of plate and furniture had to be carried about. And during the change
    of residence the City bells were set ringing. If the Queen went by
    river, or from Westminster to Greenwich, she was attended by the barges
    of the Mayor and the Companies, all newly painted and beautified: they
    had artillery on board, and there was a great shooting of guns; also
    there was “great and pleasant melodie of instruments which plaed in
    most sweet and heavenly manner.”</p>

  <p>On the day before her coronation the Queen received the Pageant devised
    in her honour by the City of London.</p>

  <p>A full account of this Pageant is preserved in a tract first printed
    in 1604, and reproduced in Nichols’s <i>Progresses of Queen Elisabeth</i>.
    It is too long to quote in full. The following, therefore, is greatly
    abridged from the original:—</p>

  <p>“Entryng the Citie was of the People received marveylous entirely, as
    appeared by the assemblie, prayers, wishes, welcomminges, cryes, tender
    woordes, and all other signs, which argue a wonderfull earnest love
    of most obedient subjectes towarde theyr soveraigne. And on thother
    side, her Grace, by holding up her hand and merie countenance to such
    as stode farre of, and most tender and gentle language to those that
    stode nigh to her Grace, did declare herselfe no leswe thankefully to
    receive her Peoples good wyll than they lovingly offered it unto her.
    To all that wyshed her Grace well, she gave heartie thankes, and to
    such as bade God save her Grace, she sayde agayne God save them all,
    and thanked them with all her heart: so that on eyther syde there
    was nothing but gladnes, nothing but prayer, nothing but comfort.
    The Quenes Majestie rejoysed marveilously to see that so exceadingly
    shewed towarde her Grace, which all good Princes have ever desyred. I
    meane so earnest love of subjectes, so evidently declared even to her
    Grace’s owne person, being carried in the middest of them.”... “Thus
    therefore the Quenes Majestie passed from the Towre till she came to
    Fanchurche, the people on eche side joyously beholdyng the viewe of so
    gracious a Ladye theyr Quene, and her Grace no lesse gladly notyng and
    observing the same. Nere unto Fanchurch was erected a scaffolde richely
    furnished, whereon stode a noyes of instrumentes and a chylde in costly
    apparell, which was appoynted to welcome the Quenes Majestie in the
    hole Cities behalfe. Against which place when her Grace came, of her
    owne wyll she commaunded the chariot to be stayde, and that the noyes
    might be appeased tyll the chylde had uttered his welcome oration,
    which he spake in English meter as here followeth:—</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">At which wordes of the last line the hole People gave a great shout,
    wishing with one assent, as the chylde had said. And the Quenes
    Majestie thanked most heartely both the Citie for this her gentle
    receiving at the first, and also the People for confirming the same.”</p>

  <p>In Gracious (Gracechurch Street) was erected a “gorgeous and sumptuous
    Arke”:—</p>

  <p>“A stage was made whiche extended from th’one syde of the streate to
    th’other, richely vawted with battlementes conteining three portes,
    and over the middlemost was avaunced three severall stages in degrees.
    Upon the lowest stage was made one seate Royall, wherein were placed
    two personages representyng Kyng Henrie the Seventh, and Elyzabeth
    his wyfe, doughter of Kyng Edward the Fourth, eyther of these two
    Princes sitting under one cloth of estate in their seates, no otherwyse
    divided, but that th’one of them, whiche was King Henrie the Seventh,
    proceeding out of the House of Lancastre, was enclosed in a Redde Rose,
    and th’other, which was Quene Elizabeth, being heire to the House of
    Yorke, enclosed with a Whyte Rose, eche of them Royally crowned, and
    decently apparailled as apperteinted to Princes, with Sceptours in
    their hands, and one vawt surmounting their heades, wherein aptly were
    placed two tables, eche conteining the title of those two Princes. And
    these personages were so set, that the one of them joined handes with
    th’other, with the ring of matrimonie perceived on the finger. Out of
    the which two Roses sprang two branches gathered into one, which were
    directed upward to the second stage or degree, wherein was placed one,
    representing the valiant and noble Prynce, King Henry the Eight, which
    sprong out of the former stock, crowned with a Crown Imperial, and by
    him sate one representing the right worthy Ladie Quene Ann, wife to the
    said King Henry the Eight, and Mother to our most soveraign Ladie Quene
    Elizabeth that now is, both apparelled with Sceptours and Diademes, and
    other furniture due to the state of a King and Queene, and two tables
    surmounting their heades, wherein were written their names and titles.
    From their seate also proceaded upwardes one braunche directed to the
    thirde and uppermost stage or degree, wherein lykewyse was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> planted
    a seate Royall, in the whiche was sette one representyng the Queenes
    most excellent Majestie Elizabeth nowe our moste dradde Soveraigne
    Ladie, crowned and apparalled as th’other Prynces were. Out of the
    forepart of this Pageaunt was made a standyng for a chylde, whiche at
    the Quenes Majesties comeing declared unto her the hole meaning of the
    said Pageaunt. The two sides of the same were filled with loud noyses
    of musicke. And all emptie places thereof were furnished with sentences
    concerning unitie. And the hole Pageant garnished with Redde Roses and
    White, and in the forefront of the same Pageant in a faire Wreathe,
    was written the name and title of the same, which was, ‘The uniting
    of the two Howses of Lancastre and Yorke.’ Thys Pageant was grounded
    upon the Quenes Majesties name. For like as the long warre between the
    two Houses of Yorke and Lancastre then ended, when Elizabeth doughter
    to Edward the Fourth matched in marriage with Henry the Seventhe,
    heyre to the Howse of Lancastre: so since that the Quenes Majesties
    name was Elizabeth, and forsomuch as she is the onelye heire of Henrye
    the Eighth, which came of bowthe the howses, as the knitting up of
    concorde, it was devised, that like as Elizabeth was the first occasion
    of concorde, so she, another Elizabeth, myght maintaine the same among
    her subjectes, so that unitie was the ende whereat the whole devise
    shotte as the Ouenes Majesties name moved the first grounde.</p>

  <p>The childe appoynted in the standing above named to open the meaning of
    the said Pageant, spake these wordes unto her Grace:—</p>

  <p>These verses and other pretie sentences were drawen in voide places
    of thys Pageant, all tending to one ende, that quietness might be
    mainteyned, and all dissention displaced, and that by the Quenes
    Majestie, heire to agrement and agreing in name with her, which tofore
    had joyned those Houses, which had been th’occasion of much debate and
    civill warre within thys Realme, as may appeare to such as will searche
    Cronicles, but be not to be touched in thys treatise, openly declaring
    her Graces passage through the Citie, and what provisyon the Citie
    made therfore. And ere the Quenes Majestie came wythin hearing of
    thys Pageaunt, she sent certaine, as also at all other Pageauntes, to
    require the People to be silent. For her Majestie was disposed to heare
    all that shoulde be sayde unto her. When the Quenes Majestie had hearde
    the chylde’s oration, and understoode the meanyng of the Pageant at
    large, she marched forward toward Cornehill, alway received with lyke
    rejoysing of the People: and there, as her Grace passed by the Conduit,
    which was curiously trimmed agaynst that tyme with riche banners
    adourned, and a noyse of loude instrumentes upon the top thereof, she
    espyed the seconde Pageant: and because she feared for the People’s
    noyse that she shoulde not heare the child which dyd expound the same,
    she enquired what that Pageant was ere that she came to it: and there
    understoode that there was a chylde representing her Majesties person,
    placed in a seate of Government, supported by certayn vertues, which
    suppressed their contrarie vyces under their feete, and so forthe.”...
    “Against Soper Lane ende was extended from th’one side of the streate
    to th’other a Pageant, which had three gates, all open. Over the
    middlemost whereof wer erected three severall stages, whereon sate
    eight children, as hereafter followeth: On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> uppermost one childe,
    on the middle three, on the lowest foure, eche having the proper name
    of the blessing that they did represent written in a table, and placed
    above their heades. In the forefront of this Pageant, before the
    children which did represent the blessings, was a convenient standing,
    cast out for a chylde to stand, which did expownd the sayd Pageant
    unto the Quenes Majestie as was done in th’other tofore. Everie of
    these children wer appointed and apparelled according unto the blessing
    which he did represent. And on the forepart of the sayde Pageant was
    written, in fayre letters, the name of the said Pageant, in this maner
    following:—</p>

  <div class="center small">
        ‘The eight Beatitudes expressed in the V chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew<br />
        applyed to our Soveraigne Lady Quene Elizabeth.’
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Over the two syde portes was placed a noyse of instrumentes. And
    all voyde places in the Pageant were furnished with prety sayinges,
    commending and touching the meaning of the said Pageant, which was
    the promises and blessinges of Almightie God to his People.”... “At
    the Standard in Cheape, which was dressed fayre agaynste the tyme,
    was placed a noyse of trumpettes, with banners and other furniture.
    The Crosse lykewyse was also made fayre and well trimmed. And neare
    unto the same, uppon the porche of Saint Peter’s church dore, stode
    the waites of the Citie, which did geve a pleasant noyse with their
    instrumentes as the Quenes Majestie did passe by, whiche on every saide
    cast her countenance and wished well to all her most loving people.
    Sone after that her Grace passed the Crosse, she had espyed the Pageant
    erected at the Little Conduit in Cheape, and incontinent required to
    know what it might signifye. And it was tolde her Grace, that there was
    placed Tyme. ‘Tyme?’ quoth she, ‘and Tyme hath brought me hether.’ And
    so forth the hole matter was opened to her Grace: as hereafter shalbe
    declared in the description of the Pageant. But in the opening when her
    Grace understode that the Byble in Englyse shoulde be delivered unto
    her by Trueth which was therin represented by a chylde: she thanked the
    Citie for that gyft, and sayde that she would oftentymes reade over
    that booke, commaunding Sir John Parrat, one of the Knightes which
    helde up her canapy, to goe before, and to receive the booke. But
    learning that it shoulde be delivered unto her Grace downe by a silken
    lace, she caused him to staye, and so passed forward till she came
    agaynste the Aldermen in the hyghe ende of Cheape tofore the Little
    Conduite, where the companies of the Citie ended, whiche beganne at
    Fanchurche and stoode along the streates, one by another enclosed with
    rayles, hanged with clothes, and themselves well apparelled with many
    riche furres, and their livery whodes uppon their shoulders, in comely
    and semely maner, having before them sondry persones well apparelled
    in silkes and chaines of golde, as wyflers and garders of the sayd
    companies, beside a number of riche<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> hangings, as well of tapistrie,
    arras, clothes of golde, silver, velvet, damaske, sattin, and other
    silkes, plentifullye hanged all the way as the Quenes Highnes passed
    from the Towre through the Citie. Out at the windowes and penthouses
    of every house did hang a number of ryche and costlye banners and
    streamers, tyll her Grace came to the upper ende of Cheape. And there,
    by appoyntment, the Right Worshipfull Maister Ranulph Cholmeley,
    Recorder of the Citie, presented to the Quenes Majestie a purse of
    crimeson sattin richely wrought with gold, wherin the Citie gave unto
    the Quenes Majestie a thousand markes in gold, as maister Recorder did
    declare brieflie unto the Quenes Majestie: whose woordes tended to this
    ende, that the Lorde Maior, his brethren, and Comminaltie of the Citie,
    to declare their gladnes and good wille towardes the Quenes Majestie
    dyd present her Grace with that golde, desyering her Grace to continue
    theyr good and gracious Queen, and not to esteeme the value of the
    gift, but the mynd of the gevers. The Quenes Majestie, with both her
    handes, tooke the purse, and answered to hym againe mervelous pithilie:
    and so pithilie, that the standers by, as they embraced entirely her
    gracious answer, so they mervailed at the cowching thereof: which was
    in wordes truely reported these: ‘I thanke my Lorde Maior, his Brethren
    and you all. And wheras your request is that I shoulde continue your
    good Ladie and Quene, be ye ensured, that I will be as good unto you
    as ever Quene was to her People. No wille in me can lacke, neither doe
    I trust shall ther lacke any power. And perswade your selves, that
    for the safetie and quietnes of you all I will not spare, if need be,
    to spend my blood. God thanke you all.’ Which answere of so noble an
    hearted Pryncesse, if it moved a mervaylous showte and rejoysing, it
    is nothyng to be mervayled at, since both the heartines thereof was
    so wonderfull and the woordes so joyntly knytte. When her Grace hadde
    thus answered the Recorder, she marched toward the Little Conduit,
    where was erected a Pageant with square proporcion standynge directly
    before the same Conduite, with battlementes accordyngelye. And in the
    same Pageant was advaunced two hylles or mountaynes of convenient
    heyghte. The one of them beyng on the North syde of the same Pageaunt,
    was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> made cragged, barreyn, and stonye: in the whiche was erected
    one tree, artificiallye made, all withered and deade, with braunches
    accordinglye. And under the same tree, at the foote thereof, sate one
    in homely and rude apparell, crokedlye, and in mourning maner, havynge
    over hys headde, in a table, written in Laten and Englyshe, hys name,
    whiche was, ‘Ruinosa Respublica,’ ‘A Decayed Commonweale.’ And upon the
    same withered tree were fixed certayne tables, wherein were written
    proper sentences, expressing the causes of the decaye of a Commonweale.
    The other hylle, on the South syde, was made fayre, fresh grene, and
    beawtifull, the grounde thereof full of flowers and beawtie: and on the
    same was erected also one tree very fresh and fayre, under the whiche
    stoode uprighte one freshe personage, well apparayled and appoynted,
    whose name also was written bothe in Englyshe and Latin, whiche was,
    ‘Respublica bene instituta,’ ‘A florishyng Commonweale.’ And uppon the
    same tree also were fixed certayne tables, conteyning sentences which
    expressed the causes of a flourishing Commonweale. In the middle,
    between the sayde hylles, was made artificially one hollow place or
    cave, with doore and locke enclosed: oute of the whiche, a lyttle
    before the Quenes Highness commynge thither, issued one personage,
    whose name was Tyme, apparaylled as an olde man, with a sythe in his
    hande, havynge wynges artificiallye made, leadinge a personage of
    lesser stature than himselfe, whiche was fynely and well apparaylled,
    all cladde in whyte silke, and directlye over her head was set her name
    and tytle, in Latin and Englyshe, ‘Temporis filia,’ ‘The Daughter of
    Tyme.’ Which two so appoynted, went forwarde toward the South syde of
    the Pageant. And on her brest was written her propre name, whiche was
    ‘Veritas,’ ‘Trueth,’ who helde a booke in her hande, upon the whiche
    was written, ‘Verbum Veritatis,’ ‘The Woorde of Trueth.’ And out of the
    South syde of the Pageaunt was cast a standynge for a childe, which
    shoulde enterprete the same Pageant. Against whom when the Quenes
    Majestie came, he spake unto her Grace these woordes:—</p>

  <p>When the childe had thus ended his speache, he reached his booke
    towardes the Quenes Majestie, whiche, a little before, Trueth had let
    downe unto him from the hill: whiche Sir John Parrat was received,
    and delivered unto the Quene. But she, as soone as she had receyved
    the booke, kissed it, and with both her handes helde up the same, and
    so laid it upon her breast, with great thankes to the Citie thereof.
    And so went forward towardes Paules Churchyarde.... When she was come
    over against Paules Scole, a childe appointed by the scolemaster
    thereof pronounced a certein oration in Latin, and certein verses,
    which also wer there written.”... “In this maner, the people on either
    side rejoysing, her Grace went forwarde, towarde the Conduite in
    Flete-street, where was the fifte and last Pageaunt erected, in forme
    following: From the Conduite, which was bewtified with painting, unto
    the North side of the strete, was erected a stage, embattelled with
    foure towres, and in the same a square platte rising with degrees, and
    uppon the uppermost degree was placed a chaire, or seate royall, and
    behynde the same seate, in curious and artificiall maner, was erected
    a tree of reasonable height, and so farre advaunced above the seate as
    it did well and semelye shadow the same, without endomaging the syght
    of any part of the Pageant: and the same tree was bewtified with leaves
    as greene as arte could devise, being of a convenient greatnes, and
    conteining therupon the fruite of the date, and on the toppe of the
    same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> tree, in a table, was set the name thereof, which was ‘A palme
    tree’: and in the aforesaide seate, or chaire, was placed a semelie
    and mete personage, richlie apparelled in Parliament robes, with a
    sceptre in her hand, as a Quene crowned with an open crowne, whose name
    and title was in a table fixed over her head, in this sort: ‘Debora
    the judge and restorer of the House of Israel, Judic. iv.’ And the
    other degrees, on either side, were furnished with vi personages: two
    representing the Nobilitie, two the Clergie, and two the Comminaltye.
    And before these personages was written, in a table, ‘Debora with her
    estates, consulting for the good Government of Israel.’ At the feete of
    these, and the lowest part of the Pageant, was ordeined a convenient
    rome for a childe to open the meaning of the Pageant. When the Quenes
    Majestie drew nere unto this Pageant, and perceived, as in the other,
    the childe readie to speake, her Grace required silence, and commaunded
    her chariot to be removed nigher, that she myght plainlie heare the

  <p class="noindent">Which verses were written upon the Pageant: and the same in Latin also.
    The voide places of the Pageant were filled with pretie sentences
    concerning the same matter. Thys ground of this last Pageant was,
    that forsomuch as the next Pageant before had set before her Grace’s
    eyes the florishing and desolate states of a Commonweale, she might
    by this be put in remembrance to consult for the worthy Government of
    her People: considering God oftimes sent women nobly to rule among
    men: as Debora, whych governed Israell in peas the space of xl years:
    and that it behoved both men and women so ruling to use advise of good
    counsell. When the Quenes Majestie had passed this Pageant, she marched
    toward Templebarre: but at St Dunstones church, where the children of
    thospitall wer appointed to stand with their governours, her Grace
    perceiving a childe offred to make an oration unto her, stayed her
    chariot and did cast up her eyes to heaven, as who should saye: ‘I here
    see thys mercyfull worke towarde the poore, whom I muste in the middest
    of my royaltie nedes remembre!’ And so turned her face towarde the
    childe, which, in Latin, pronounced an oracion. The childe, after he
    had ended his oracion, kissed the paper wherein the same was written,
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>reached it to the Quenes Majestie, whych received it graciouslye
    both with woordes and countenance, declaring her gracious mynde
    towarde theyr reliefe. From thence her Grace came to Temple Barre,
    which was dressed fynelye with the two ymages of Gotmagot the Albione,
    and Corineus the Briton, two gyantes bigge in stature, furnished
    accordingly: which held in their handes, even above the gate, a table,
    wherin was writen, in Latin verses, the effect of all the Pageantes
    which the Citie before had erected. Which versis wer also written in

    for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> maintenaunce of Trueth and rooting out of Errour, she now and
    then helde up her handes to heavenwarde, and willed the people to say
    Amen. When the child had ended she said, ‘Be ye well assured I will
    stande your good Quene.’ At whiche saying her Grace departed forth
    through Temple Barre towarde Westminster with no lesse shoutyng and
    crying of the People, then she entred the Citie, with a noyse of
    ordinance, whiche the Towre shot of at her Grace’s entraunce first into
    Towre-streate. The childes saying was also in Latin verses, wrytten in
    a table which was hanged up there. Thus the Quenes Hyghnesse passed
    through the Citie, whiche, without any forreyne persone, of itselfe
    beawtifyed itselfe, and receyved her Grace at all places, as hath
    been before mentioned, with most tender obedience and love, due to
    so gracious a Quene and Soveraigne Ladie. And her Grace lykewise of
    her side, in all her Grace’s passage, shewed herselfe generally an
    ymage of a woorthye Ladie and Governour: but privately these especiall
    poyntes wer noted in her Grace as synges of a most princelyke courage,
    wherby her loving subjectes maye ground a sure hope for the rest of her
    gracious doinges hereafter.”</p>

  <p>The most beautiful thing about the accession and coronation of
    Elizabeth was the moment when she passed out of the gates of the Tower,
    where once before she had lain in daily expectation of death. Her
    carriage waited for her. She stood looking round her; in the clear,
    cold, winter light she saw the City rising before her with its spires
    and gables—her City—filled with hearts that longed above all things
    for the restoration of the new Faith. And she raised her eyes to heaven
    and cried:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“O Lord, Almighty and Everlasting God, I give Thee most humble
      thanks, that Thou hast been so merciful unto me as to spare me to
      behold this joyful day; and I acknowledge that Thou hast dealt
      wonderfully and mercifully with me. As Thou didst with thy servant
      Daniel the prophet, whom Thou deliveredst out of the den from the
      cruelty of the raging lions, even so was I overwhelmed, and only
      by Thee delivered. To Thee, therefore, only be thanks, honour, and
      praise for ever. Amen.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Service in the Abbey was the Coronation Mass; but the Litany was
    read in English, and the Gospel and Epistle both in Latin and in
    English. All the Bench of Bishops were absent except one; and the Abbot
    of Westminster took his part in the Service for the last time. Yet a
    few weeks and all England knew that the Reformation had come back to
    them. For this gift the people never ceased to love and venerate Queen
    Elizabeth. There has been no English sovereign save Queen Victoria who
    was so wholly and unfeignedly loved by the English people as she. This
    is a commonplace, but it is well, in such a work as this, to remind
    ourselves how the citizens of London, one and all, and throughout her
    long reign, were ready to fight and to die for their beloved Queen.
    She was sometimes hard; she was always inflexible; she was sometimes
    vindictive; but above all things people delight in a strong king. Henry
    the First; Henry the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> Second; Edward the First; Henry the Fifth; Henry
    the Eighth; Elizabeth; William the Third,—have been the best loved of
    all the English sovereigns, because of their strength and courage. In
    the woman’s heart of the Maiden Queen lay all the courage and all the
    strength of her masterful father.</p>

  <p>The new opinions made rapid and, for the most part, unchecked advance.
    It was observed how, at the burial of a certain gentlewoman in St.
    Thomas Acons, no priests or singing clerks were present, but in their
    stead the new preachers in their gowns, who neither spoke nor sang
    until they came to the church, and when the body was lowered into the
    grave, a Collect was read in English, instead of Latin, and a chapter
    of St. Paul was read—probably the same chapter which is now read at
    funerals. The spirit of the time was also marked by a Proclamation
    forbidding the players of whatever Company to play any more for a
    certain time.</p>

  <p>It has been observed that there were few noblemen left in the City:
    we observe, however, that Lord Wentworth when he was acquitted for
    the loss of Calais, went to live at Whittington College. At the
    funeral service held for the death of King Henry II. of France the
    sermon, preached by the Bishop-elect of Hereford, turned upon Funeral
    Ceremonies, pointing out the simplicity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> Primitive Church—a
    sermon pointing to change; after the sermon the Communion was
    administered both of wine and of bread.</p>

  <p>In August, on St. Bartholomew’s Day, there was a great burning of
    roods, copes, crosses, altar cloths, rood cloths, books, banners, and
    other church gear, in London. In May, six months after the Queen’s
    accession, the English service was ordered to be held in all the
    churches. And the Mayor and Aldermen who had been accustomed to go in
    procession to St. Paul’s, there to pray at the tomb of Bishop William,
    with other ceremonies, changed this practice into hearing a sermon.
    Early in 1560 we find the people all together singing a Psalm in metre,
    the custom having been brought from abroad by the Protestant refugees.
    By this time the Protestant form of worship seems to have been firmly
    established, though it wanted the Spanish Armada and the risings and
    conspiracies in favour of the old Faith to make it impossible that the
    great mass of the people should desire a return.</p>

  <p>Meantime not only by her Progresses, but by her evenings on the river,
    her presence at jousts and tilts, her personal reviewing of troops and
    trained-bands, Queen Elizabeth kept herself continually in evidence.
    (<i>See</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_IV">Appendix IV.</a>) The people crowded after her, especially on the
    river, where in her honour they fired off guns and blew trumpets, beat
    drums, played lutes, and threw squibs into the air. The Queen even
    took part in the rough national sports, sitting for whole afternoons
    with the Foreign Ambassadors, looking on at the baiting of bears and
    bulls, and hawking was a favourite amusement of hers. A description of
    Whitehall Palace and its treasures is given by the German traveller
    Hentzner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In Whitehall are the following things worthy of observation:—</p>

    <p>I. The Royal Library, well stored with Greek, Latin, Italian,
      and French books: amongst the rest, a little one in French, upon
      parchment, in the handwriting of the present reigning Queen
      Elizabeth, thus inscribed: ‘To the most High, Puissant, and
      Redoubted Prince, Henry VIII. of the Name, King of England, France,
      and Ireland, Defender of the Faith: Elizabeth his most humble
      daughter, Health &amp; Obedience.’ All these books are bound in velvet
      of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and
      silver: some of pearls and precious stones set in their bindings.</p>

    <p>II. Two little silver cabinets of exquisite work, in which the
      Queen keeps her paper, and which she uses for writing-boxes.</p>

    <p>III. The Queen’s bed, ingeniously composed of woods of different
      colours, with quilts of silk, velvet, gold, silver, and embroidery.</p>

    <p>IV. A little chest, ornamented all over with pearls, in which
      the Queen keeps her bracelets, ear-rings, and other things of
      extraordinary value.</p>

    <p>V. Christ’s Passion in painted glass.</p>

    <p>VI. Portraits: among which are Queen Elizabeth at sixteen years
      old; Henry, Richard, Edward, Kings of England; Rosamond; Lucrece;
      a Grecian Bride, in her nuptial habit; the Genealogy of the Kings
      of England; a picture of King Edward VI. representing at first
      sight something quite deformed, till, by looking through a small
      hole in the cover, which is put over it, you see it in its true
      proportions; Charles V., Emperor; Charles Emanuel Duke of Savoy,
      and Catherine of Spain his wife; Ferdinand Duke of Florence, with
      his Daughters; one of Philip King of Spain when he came into
      England and married Mary; Henry VII., Henry VIII. and his Mother;
      besides many more of illustrious men and women, and a picture of
      the Siege of Malta.</p>

    <p>VII. A small hermitage, half hid in rock, finely carved in wood.</p>

    <p>VIII. Variety of emblems, on paper, cut in the shape of shields,
      with mottoes, used by the nobility at tilts and tournaments, hung
      up here for a memorial.</p>

    <p>IX. Different instruments of music, upon one of which two persons
      may perform at the same time.</p>

    <p>X. A piece of clock-work, an Aethiop riding upon a rhinoceros, with
      four attendants, who all make their obeisance when it strikes the
      hour: these are all put into motion, by winding up the machine. At
      the entrance into the park from Whitehall is this inscription:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">

          <div class="i0">The Fisherman who has been wounded learns though late to beware</div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>In a garden joining to this Palace, there is a Jet d’eau with a
      sun-dial, which, while strangers are looking at, a quantity of
      water, forced by a wheel, which the gardiner turns at a distance,
      through a number of little pipes, plentifully sprinkles those that
      are standing round.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The entertainment of a noble visitor was hospitable and generous. This
    is shown in the case of John Casimir, Count Palatine of the Rhine and
    Duke of Bavaria. He arrived about seven of the clock on the evening of
    22nd January 1579. He landed at the Tower, and was there received by
    divers noblemen and others, who conveyed him by cresset and torchlight
    to the house of Sir Thomas Gresham in Bishopsgate Street, where he
    was received with the sounding of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> trumpets, drums, fifes, and other
    instruments, and a great concourse of people; here he rested for
    some days. He was then taken by some of the nobility to the Queen at
    Westminster, and lodged at Somerset House. The week after he hunted
    at Hampton Court. On Sunday the first of February he was entertained
    with a great tilting at Westminster; on Monday with a sword-fight at
    barriers. On Tuesday he dined with the Mayor; on Wednesday with the
    Duchess of Suffolk at the Barbican; on Thursday at the Steelyard. On
    February the 8th he was made a Knight of the Garter. And when he went
    away he took with him presents worth 3000 crowns.</p>

  <p>The tiltings at Westminster attracted an immense number of spectators:
    in the year 1581 so great was the concourse and so crowded were the
    scaffolds that they broke down, and many persons were injured or killed.</p>

  <p>April the 4th, 1581, was a day to be remembered. On that day the Queen
    came from Greenwich by water to Deptford, where there was moored a
    certain ship newly returned from a voyage round the world, the first
    made by an Englishman. The ship was called <i>The Golden Hind</i>, the
    Captain, Francis Drake. The Queen examined the ship, questioned the
    Captain, looked at the charts, and saw the things collected and brought
    home. Then she graciously dined on board, and after dinner conferred
    the honour of knighthood upon the Captain. An immense number of persons
    were gathered to see the Queen, and to gaze upon the ship which had
    been all round the world. A wooden bridge on which one hundred persons
    were standing broke, but happily none were killed. The ship was laid
    up in Deptford Dockyard, till she was cut to pieces by visitors taking
    each a piece of her timbers away. When she was at length broken up, a
    chair was made out of the wood, and given by a Mr. John Davis to the
    University of Oxford.</p>

  <p>The observance of the Maundy was held in great state:—</p>

  <p>First, the Hall was prepared with a long table on each side, and forms
    set by them; on the edges of which tables and under those forms were
    laid carpets and cushions for her Majesty to kneel, when she washed
    the poor. There was also another table laid across the upper end of
    the Hall, where the Chaplain stood. A little beneath the middle of the
    Hall a stool and “cushion of estate” were placed for her Majesty to
    kneel at during service time. This done, the holy-water basons, alms,
    and other things, being brought into the Hall, and the Chaplain and the
    poor women, the recipients of the Queen’s bounty, having taken their
    places, the Yeoman of the Laundry, armed with a fair towel, and taking
    a silver bason filled with warm water and flowers, washed their feet,
    all, one after another, wiped the same with his towel, and so, making
    a cross a little above the toes, kissed them. After them followed the
    Sub-Almoner, doing likewise, and after him the Almoner himself also;
    so that the feet of the poor folk were three times washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> before the
    Queen appeared. When she came into the Hall, they sang certain psalms
    and read certain prayers, together with the Gospel of Christ’s washing
    His disciples’ feet; then thirty-nine gentlewomen [in accordance with
    the Queen’s age—this account refers to the year 1572] presented
    themselves with aprons and towels to wait upon her Majesty; and she,
    kneeling down upon the cushions and carpets under the feet of the poor
    women, first washed one foot of every one of them in so many several
    basons of warm water, and sweet flowers, brought to her severally by
    the said ladies and gentlewomen, then wiped, crossed, and kissed them,
    as the Almoner and others had done before. When her Majesty had thus
    gone through the whole number of thirty-nine (of which twenty sat on
    the one side of the Hall and nineteen on the other) she began again
    with the first, and gave to each one certain yards of broad cloth.
    This done, she again began with the first, giving to each in turn a
    pair of shoes. Fourthly, to each of them she gave a wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> platter,
    wherein were laid a side of salmon, with an equal weight of ling, six
    red herring, and two loaves of bread. Fifthly, she began with the
    first again, and gave to each of them a white wooden bason filled with
    wine. Sixthly, she received of each Waiting Gentlewoman her towel and
    apron, and gave one towel and apron to each poor woman. After this the
    Treasurer of the Chamber came to her Majesty with thirty-nine small
    white purses wherein were also thirty-nine pence according to the
    number of the years of her Majesty’s age; and of him she received and
    distributed them severally; which done, she received of him the same
    number of red leather purses, each containing twenty shillings, for the
    redemption of her Majesty’s gown, which, by ancient custom, should have
    been given to some one of them at her pleasure; the Queen, however,
    had changed that reward into money, to be equally divided amongst them
    all, namely, twenty shillings apiece; and those she also delivered
    particularly to each one of the whole company; and “so, taking her
    ease upon the cushion of state, and hearing the choir a little while,
    her Majesty withdrew herself and the company departed; for it was by
    that time the sun-setting.” This account is taken from that of William
    Lambarde an Antiquary, who is quoted by John Nichols in his <i>Progresses
      of Queen Elizabeth</i> (vol. i.).</p>

  <p>The custom of making New Year’s gifts to the Queen was duly honoured
    every year. The list of the gifts for 1562 as presented by Nichols
    contains the names of all the noble lords and great ladies in the
    kingdom, the Bishops, and the Court: nearly two hundred in number.
    These gifts are of all kinds: gold boxes; purses of money; embroidered
    sleeves; sugar loaves; ginger; sweetmeats; a smock of silk;
    handkerchiefs “garnished with gold, silver, and silk”; carved coffers;
    sleeves embroidered with gold; silk hose—two such gifts; fine glass;
    gilt cups; tankards, bowls, spoons, and salts; and so on. On the other
    hand, the gifts which the Queen had to make constantly to Ambassadors,
    to her officers, to the christening and marriage feasts of the people
    about the Court, would seem to run away with most of these presents. It
    is worthy of note that in all the long list of gifts of 1562 there is
    not one single picture or statue.</p>

  <p>The following is Hentzner’s account of the Queen’s Court at Greenwich
    (Nichols vol. ii.):—</p>

  <p>“We next arrived at the Royal Palace of Greenwich, reported to have
    been originally built by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and to have
    received very magnificent additions from Henry VII. It was here
    Elizabeth, the present Queen, was born, and here she generally resides,
    particularly in Summer, for the delightfulness of its situation.
    We were admitted, by an order Mr. Rogers procured from the Lord
    Chamberlain, into the Presence Chamber, hung with rich tapestry, and
    the floor after the English fashion strewed with hay, through which
    the Queen commonly passes on her way to Chapel; at the door stood a
    Gentleman <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>dressed in velvet, with a gold chain, whose office was
    to introduce to the Queen any person of distinction that came to wait
    on her; it was Sunday, when there is usually the greatest attendance
    of Nobility. In the same Hall were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
    Bishop of London, a great number of Counselors of State, Officers of
    the Crown, and Gentlemen, who waited the Queen’s coming out: which
    she did from her own apartment when it was time to go to prayers,
    attended in the following manner: First went Gentlemen, Barons, Earls,
    Knights of the Garter, all richly dressed and bareheaded; next came the
    Chancellor, bearing the seals in a red silke purse, between two; one of
    which carried the Royal Sceptre, the other the Sword of State, in a red
    scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next
    came the Queen, in the sixty-fifth year of her age, as we are told,
    very majestic: her face oblong, fair, but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet
    black and pleasant; her nose a little hooked; her lips narrow and her
    teeth black (defect the English seem subject to from their too great
    use of sugar); she had in her ears two pearls, with very rich drops;
    she wore false hair and that red; upon her head she had a small crown,
    reported to be made of some of the gold of the celebrated Lunebourg
    Table. Her bosom was uncovered, as all the English Ladies have it till
    they marry; and she had on a necklace of exceeding fine jewels; her
    hands were small, her fingers long, and her stature neither tall nor
    low; her air was stately, her manner of speaking mild and obliging.
    That day she was dressed in white silk, bordered with pearls of the
    size of beans, and over it a mantle of black silk, shot with silver
    threads; her train was very long, the end of it borne by a Marchioness;
    instead of a chain, she had an oblong collar of gold and jewels. As
    she went along in all this state and magnificence, she spoke very
    graciously, first to one, then to another, whether foreign ministers
    or those who attended for different reasons, in English, French, and
    Italian; for, besides being well skilled in Greek, Latin, and the
    languages I have mentioned, she is mistress of Spanish, Scotch, and
    Dutch; whoever speaks to her, it is kneeling; now and then she raises
    some with her hand. While we were there, W. Slawata, a Bohemian Baron,
    had letters to present to her; and she, after pulling off her glove,
    gave him her right hand to kiss, sparkling with rings and jewels, a
    mark of particular favour; wherever she turned her face as she was
    going along, everybody fell down on their knees. The ladies of the
    Court followed next to her, very handsome and well-shaped, and for
    the most part dressed in white; she was guarded on each side by the
    Gentlemen Pensioners, fifty in number, with gilt battle-axes. In the
    anti-chapel next the Hall, where we were, petitions were presented
    to her, and she received them most graciously, which occasioned the
    acclamation of ‘Long live Queen Elizabeth!’ She answered it with, ‘I
    thank you, my good people.’ In the Chapel was excellent music; as soon
    as it and the service was over, which scarce exceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> half an hour,
    the Queen returned in the same state and order, and prepared to go to
    dinner. But while she was still at prayers, we saw her table set out
    with the following solemnity: A Gentleman entred the room bearing a
    rod, and along with him another who had a table-cloth, which, after
    they had both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration, he spread
    upon the table, and after kneeling again they both retired. Then came
    two others, one with the rod again, the other with a salt-cellar, a
    plate, and bread; when they had both kneeled, as the others had done,
    and placed what was brought upon the table, they too retired with the
    same ceremonies performed by the first. At last came an unmarried
    lady (we were told she was a Countess) and along with her a married
    one, bearing a tasting knife; the former was dressed in white silk,
    who, when she had prostrated herself three times in the most graceful
    manner, approached the table, and rubbed the plates with bread and
    salt, with as much awe as if the Queen had been present; when they
    had waited there a little while, the Yeomen of the Guard entered,
    bare-headed, cloathed in scarlet, with a golden rose upon their backs,
    bringing in at each turn a course of twenty-four dishes, served in
    plate, most of it gilt; these dishes were received by a gentleman in
    the same order they were brought, and placed upon the table, while
    the lady-taster gave to each of the guards a mouthful to eat, of the
    particular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison. During the time
    that this guard, which consists of the tallest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> stoutest men that
    can be found in all England, being carefully selected for the service,
    were bringing dinner, twelve trumpets and two kettle-drums made the
    hall ring for half an hour together. At the end of this ceremonial, a
    number of unmarried ladies appeared, who, with particular solemnity,
    lifted the meat off the table, and conveyed it into the Queen’s inner
    and more private chamber, where, after she has chosen for herself, the
    rest goes to the Ladies of the Court. The Queen dines and sups alone,
    with very few attendants; and it is very seldom that anybody, foreigner
    or native, is admitted at that time, and then only at the intercession
    of somebody in power.”</p>

  <p>The great popularity of the Queen, and the affection with which she
    was regarded by all classes, is shown by the following Proclamation
    issued in the year 1563, relating to persons making portraits of Queen
    Elizabeth:—</p>

  <p>“Forasmuch as thrugh the natural desire that all sorts of subjects and
    peple, both noble and mean, have to procure the portrait and picture of
    the Queen’s Majestie, great nomber of Paynters, and some Printers and
    gravers, have alredy and doe dayly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> attempt to make in divers manners
    portraietures of hir Majestie in paynting, graving, and prynting,
    wherein is evidently shewn that hytherto none hath sufficiently
    expressed the naturall representation of hir Majesties person, favor,
    or grace, but for the most part have also erred therein, as thereof
    dayly complaints are made amongst hir Majesties loving subjectes, in so
    much that for redres hereof hir Majestie hath lately bene so instantly
    and so importunately sued unto by the Lords of hir Consell and others
    of hir nobility, in respect of the great disorder herein used, not only
    to be content that some speciall conning payntor might be permitted
    by access to hir Majestie to take the natural representation of hir
    Majestie, whereof she hath bene allwise of her own right disposition
    very unwillyng, but also to prohibit all manner of other persons to
    draw, paynt, grave, or pourtrayet hir Majesties personage or visage for
    a time, untill by some perfect patron and example the same may be by
    others followed. Therfor hir Majestie, being herein as it were overcome
    with the contynuall requests of so many of hir Nobility and Lords,
    whom she cannot well deny, is pleased that for their contentations,
    some coning person mete therefor shall shortly make a pourtrait of
    hir person or visage to be participated to others for satisfaction of
    hir loving subjects, and furthermore commandeth all manner of persons
    in the mean tyme to forbear from payntyng, graving, printing, or
    making of any pourtraits of hir Majestie, until some speciali person
    that shall be by hir allowed shall have first finished a pourtraiture
    thereof, after which fynished, hir Majestie will be content that all
    other painters, printers, or gravers, that shall be known men of
    understanding, and so thereto licensed by the hed officers of the
    plaices where they shall dwell (as reason it is that every person
    should not without consideration attempt the same) shall and maye at
    their pleasures follow the sayd patron or first portraiture. And for

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> speaking of the Dissolution of the Religious Houses it must be
    understood that I am considering this momentous step with reference to
    London only. The influences of the Continental movement; the lessons
    of history; the turn taken by theological controversy; the unedifying
    spectacle of Rome in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; the
    talk of scholars; the strength of the conservatism which rallied
    about the Church at first; the apparent power of the Church, which
    seemed, indeed, able to crush every opponent, whatever his rank and
    station;—these things moved not, consciously at least, the man of
    London. He became acquiescent in the changes imposed upon him by
    other considerations. And I believe that had not his acquiescence
    been understood as certain to follow, these changes would not have
    been attempted. Henry VIII. was the most masterful sovereign of
    his time; but a king cannot outrage and trample upon the settled
    religious faith of his subjects. The Old Faith had gone to pieces when
    Constantine proclaimed the New. The New, in its turn, now grown old and
    incrustated, and hidden by a thousand additions, superstitions, and
    superfluities, was in its turn ready for departure, in Northern Europe
    at least, when Henry effected the separation from Rome which began the
    Reformation in England.</p>

  <p>Among an ignorant and an uncritical people the ancient Faith passed
    unquestioned—was it not the Faith of all those in authority? Its
    doctrines were supported less by teaching than by outward forms,
    ceremonies, pageants, splendours and traditional conventions. In every
    church the story of the Gospels was partly represented, but overlaid
    with stories of the Saints; the Christian virtues were never, even
    at the lowest point of Church History, forgotten, yet their practice
    had become crystallised; almsgiving was part of the Rule of every
    Religious Order, but it was indiscriminate; mercy towards the criminal
    had become a refuge for those who continued in their evil practices
    under cover of Sanctuary; the tradition of austerity no longer
    brought respect to the Benedictine; the tradition of self-sacrifice
    no longer brought love to the Franciscan: to the former, as to the
    College of All Souls, Oxford, the members were <i>bene nati</i>, and, I
    believe, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> most part <i>bene morati</i> and <i>moderate docti</i>; in
    the more secluded religious communities discipline was relaxed and
    scandals had crept in; for a hundred years and more the people had
    been gradually ceasing to endow the Religious Houses with bequests.
    At the commencement of the sixteenth century they had wholly ceased
    the practice, formerly universal. Monk and Nun; Friar and Sister;
    Hermit, Anchorite, Anchress, now received no more bequests; of all the
    Religious Orders none had fallen into disrepute so hopelessly as the
    Franciscans: they were selling the lead off the roofs of their stately
    churches; they were selling their sacred vessels of silver gilt; their
    boxes, hung up in the shops—if the shopkeepers admitted them—received
    no more offerings; they were insulted in the streets; their numbers
    were dwindling daily. Now all these things were like an open book in
    which those who passed along the way might read daily, and did read
    unconsciously, so that their minds were moulded and directed, they
    could not tell why or how.</p>

  <p>As for the spread of the ideas called Lollardry, one knows not how far
    they survived the persecution under Henry V. and the disturbances of
    the Civil Wars. But such ideas, whose strength lies in the exercise
    of reason, so far as men can reason, do not easily die; the case of
    Richard Hun (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>) shows that they were still alive. The socialistic
    side of Lollardry had vanished, but some, at least, of the religious
    side survived.</p>

  <p>Yet the old things went on apparently undisturbed. Nothing could
    surpass the external splendour of a Cardinal Archbishop: no authority
    was greater in appearance than his. The rich endowments of the greater
    Abbeys made the Houses magnificent and the Brethren proud, generous,
    and profuse in hospitality and in alms. Who could be more dignified
    than the Abbot of St. Peter’s, Westminster? Still the Church seemed to
    rule in everything: the Fraternities continued; they still attracted
    members; they still marched in procession, each with its chaplain and
    its singing men, its banners and its brethren, through the streets on
    its appointed day; the City Companies were incorporated as Religious as
    well as Trade Societies; the Manger and the Holy Tomb still adorned the
    churches on the great Festivals; the Angel still flew over the people
    from the roof on the Day of Pentecost; the pictures on the wall in
    every church recorded the martyrdom of the Saint of Dedication and the
    miracles which commanded his canonisation. No one could have dreamed,
    no one could have prophesied, when the scholarly young King thundered
    against Luther that the old order was drawing to its allotted end, and
    that for Rome, as well as Northern Europe, Reform was at hand.</p>

  <p>In many ways the Church had long lost its former hold. No longer were
    the architects Churchmen; no longer were the bridge builders a distinct
    fraternity; the lawyers were clerks, indeed, but not in Holy Orders;
    the King’s Ministers were no longer necessarily of the Clergy; scholars
    were no longer of necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> ordained priests or deacons; physicians
    were laymen; the clergy were allowed to practise surgery, provided
    that they did not use fire or steel—in other words, did not conduct
    operations; in trade the lending of money—formerly in the hands of
    the Jews and afterwards in those of the so-called “Caursini,” Italians
    licensed by the Popes—was now recognised as necessary, and was carried
    on more or less openly by merchants; in a word, the daily life of the
    world, which had been shot through and through, like a piece of silk
    with its coloured threads, by Religion, had long been emancipating
    itself, by slow and gradual steps, from the control of the Church and
    the interference of the priest.</p>

  <p>How much these things were understood at the time it is not necessary
    to inquire. Probably the people, who knew no history, had been
    unconsciously moulded and changed, and were far from realising the
    great gulf which now divided them from their ancestors.</p>

  <p>Yet there were other signs of change, could they have been rightly
    interpreted. Scholars, like Erasmus, openly derided the adoration of
    relics; some of them, under new Pagan influence, denied the Christian
    faith itself; the scholars of France, like Rabelais and Étienne Dolet,
    scoffed at the Pope and the Papal pretensions; yet Rabelais did not
    dare to publish in his lifetime the most daring and the most deadly
    part of his work.</p>

  <p>Add to these things the long-standing disaffection towards the
    Roman authority. For centuries the Pope had been attempting fresh
    encroachments, claiming new powers, demanding more contributions.
    All travellers to Rome brought back the same story of corruption and
    laxity; men asked themselves why they should submit to the oppression
    of an Italian prince. In 1529 the House of Commons drew up a petition
    in which, while they did not ask for a change of doctrine, they
    complained of the independent legislation claimed by Convocation, the
    number of officers, the exorbitant fees of ecclesiastical courts, the
    granting of benefices to children, pluralities, non-residence and other
    grievances. Surely such a man as Wolsey must have discerned in all
    these symptoms a warning, clear and loud, that their house must be set
    in order. Perhaps not, however: nothing is more difficult than for the
    ecclesiastical mind to see, outside its fences of doctrine and usage,
    the questioning people, and to hear and understand the awakened mind.</p>

  <p>The action of Henry, which, on the face of it, seems the most masterful
    thing ever attempted by a king, was, on the contrary, approved and
    accepted by the great mass of the people; especially by the people of
    London, by the scholars, and by the clergy. There were few who emulated
    the constancy of the unfortunate Carthusians or the martyrdom of More
    and Fisher; the old order crumbled and fell to pieces at a touch;
    out of the débris, among the fallen monarchs of the forest, rose up
    a tangled mass of vegetation, from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> nobler kinds had to be
    separated by trial and proof, by persecution and by cultivation.</p>

  <p>The first direct step towards the Reformation was, assuredly, not
    considered as such. It was the suppression by Cardinal Wolsey of
    certain small houses with whose revenues he endowed his Colleges.</p>

  <p>The second direct step was the Petition of the House of Commons, which
    also passed the Upper House, in 1529.</p>

  <p>In January 1531 the House of Commons, in demanding of the clergy the
    payment of £118,000—an enormous sum, representing more than a million
    of our money—gave Henry the title of Head of the Church. This was
    before the break with Rome; so far it meant only that the civil power
    should be superior to the ecclesiastical.</p>

  <p>Then followed the Bill for the abolition of <i>annales</i> or payment to the
    Pope of the first year’s income of benefice or see. This was at first
    held <i>in terrorem</i> over the head of the Pope.</p>

  <p>The divorce of Katherine and the King’s marriage with Anne Boleyn
    in spite of the opposition of the Pope completed the separation.
    Henceforth the King was Head of the Church within his own realm.</p>

  <p>It was to show to the whole world that he was in earnest and that he
    meant indeed to be Head of the Church, that Henry caused the execution
    of the Carthusian monks, of Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas More. All
    Christendom shuddered when those holy men were dragged forth to suffer
    the degrading and horrible death of traitors; yet all Christendom
    recognised that there was a King in England who would brook no
    interference, who knew his own mind, and would work his own will.</p>

  <p>I need not follow the course and the development of the Reformation,
    for its history belongs to the whole country. As regards London, two or
    three points present themselves for consideration: as, for instance,
    the condition of the Houses; the manners and morality of the Religious;
    and the mind of the people.</p>

  <p>Let us consider these points from the position of a contemporary
    Londoner, so far as is possible. First, as to the condition of the
    Houses.</p>

  <p>The enormous wealth of the Church could not fail to impress every one
    with the incongruity of ecclesiastical professions and practices.
    The sight of those scores of able-bodied men, most of them with no
    pretensions to be considered scholars, or divines, or even gentlemen—a
    qualification which, at the time, might have been sufficient
    justification for living on the work of others—but men of low origin
    and of narrow attainments, lounging about the streets and in the
    taverns—some, as the friars, with no apparent duties at all; some,
    like the chantry priests, with half an hour’s work every day; many
    of them without the least pretence to piety or virtue—could not but
    become a powerful aid in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> popular approval of the Dissolution. In
    London alone, a very large part of the City belonged to the Church.
    The streets swarmed with ecclesiastics who, in the midst of a busy and
    industrial population, seemed idle and useless.</p>

  <p>In the Italian <i>Relations of England</i> the writer speaks of the vast
    wealth of the Church and the power of the ecclesiastics. “I for my
    part,” he says, “believe that the English priests would desire nothing
    better than what they have got, were it not they are obliged to assist
    the Crown in time of war, and also to keep many poor gentlemen, who are
    left beggars in consequence of the inheritance devolving to the eldest
    son. And if the Bishops were to decline this expense they would be
    considered infamous, nor do I believe that they would be safe in their
    own churches.”</p>

    <div class="caption">CARTHUSIAN MARTYRS<br />
      From a historical print in the British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>There is surely some confusion here. It is true that younger sons
    attached themselves to the following of the great Lords Spiritual as
    well as Temporal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> but I have nowhere else found it stated that it was
    the duty of the Church to keep them. Also many of them, as we have
    seen, had City connections and embarked in trade. For “Church” we
    should perhaps read “the Monastic Houses.”</p>

  <p>If we come to consider the condition of the Religious on the score
    of morality, all that can be said concerning those of London is that
    we hear nothing against them. It is true that the details of the
    Visitations of London have not been revealed. But there could not
    have been anything very bad, or it would have been laid hold of and
    enlarged upon, and pointed out for the execration of the people, by the
    preachers of the new religion.</p>

  <p>Froude, in his paper on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, argues
    that the evidence of immorality on the part of certain Religious
    Houses is overwhelming. His case against that of St. Albans is
    certainly convincing, so far as that House alone is concerned. And
    it is difficult not to believe that in other cases about the country
    the evidence of the visitors, even granting that their own private
    character left a good deal to be desired, is much too detailed for pure
    invention.</p>

  <p>But, as regards the Religious of London, I am not aware that there is
    any evidence to prove that they were either notoriously or secretly
    corrupt or luxurious. Considering the pristine standard of the Rule,
    they were doubtless degenerate, just as in a College of Oxford or
    Cambridge fifty years ago, the Fellows who should have carried on
    the lamp of learning spent their time in the study of Port and the
    practice of Whist. Father Gasquet argues in favour of the whole body
    of nuns—London or country—when he cites the case of Sister Joan. In
    the year 1535 the Archbishop of York visited a certain convent in his
    diocese and learned that one of the nuns had been guilty of unchastity.
    He inflicted upon her a sentence of great severity: she was to be
    kept in prison for two years, without speaking to any one but the
    Prioress; she was to fast altogether on Wednesday and Friday; and on
    every Friday she was to be taken to the Chapter House, there to receive
    discipline—<i>i.e.</i> to be whipped. Is it possible, Father Gasquet asks,
    that the nunneries of England could be grossly and openly immoral—even
    secretly immoral—when such a severe punishment was meted out to an
    offender by the visiting archbishop? One might point out that a severe
    punishment may tell of two things: either of horror at a rare and
    heinous offence, or of a determination, by severe measures, to put down
    a too frequent breaking of the vows of chastity.</p>

  <p>Concerning, therefore, the morals of the London Religious, there has
    been no special charge, so far as I know, brought against the whole
    body. We may remember, however, that the number of persons bound by
    vows of celibacy was very large; that even at the present time, when
    there is certainly more self-restraint, it would be impossible for
    these vows to be kept by so large a proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> of the people; and that
    the clergy, in morals and in practice, have never been more than a
    little in advance of the laity.</p>

  <p>The many acts of unchastity of which one reads in the books were
    perhaps scattered and solitary instances. I refer, however, to
    certain documents which prove, not the common prevalence of vice, but
    relaxation of the Rule. They are a collection of papers, the charges of
    Langland, Bishop of Lincoln, early in the sixteenth century, published
    in <i>Archæologia</i> (vol. xlvii.). They point to laxity, not to vice.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">SIR THOMAS MORE (1478–1535)<br />
      From the painting by Holbein in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The first is a charge to the Abbess and Convent of Elstow, near
    Bedford. In this House the Sisters, instead of assembling in the
    Fratry for their meals, were accustomed to gather together in what
    they called their “Households”; apparently messes of two or more, at
    which secular men, women, and children were allowed to be present. This
    has to be amended. Henceforth they may repair to the Misericorde, but
    only one or two at a time, and then under charge of an elderly sister.
    Their attendance at the services in the “Quire” has become irregular,
    henceforth they are all to attend every service; they are not to look
    about the church upon the people during service, for which purpose
    a door is to be constructed shutting off the choir. They had become
    irregular about their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> dress, henceforth they are not to wear their
    dresses cut low. As for the Lady Abbess, she herself is ordered to get
    up and attend matins with the rest, and not to break her fast nor to
    sup with the steward or any secular man.</p>

  <p>Clearly, a House requiring reformation, yet not blameworthy of the
    grosser sins.</p>

  <p>There was the Priory of Studley, a Benedictine Nunnery in the Parish of
    Beckley, Oxfordshire, the burial-place of the British Saint Donanverdh,
    and one of the residences of Richard of Almayn, brother of Henry. The
    Prioress is warned to dismiss a certain steward, named Marten Whighill;
    she is not to suffer her ladies to become godmothers, nor to go out
    on visits to their kinsfolk “onles it be for their comforte in tyme
    of ther syknesse, and yett nott then onlesse it shal seme to you,
    ladye priores, to be behoveful and necessarye, seeing that undre such
    pretence muche insolency have bene used in religion.” Considering,
    further, that the House is in great debt, the Prioress is to grant no
    more corrodies, <i>i.e.</i> right of board and lodging in the House; to have
    fewer servants; and to live “in a scarcer manour.” She is to look more
    carefully after the food of the Sisters; she is to see that they wear
    their robes; and she is to admit more ladies.</p>

  <p>The Prioress of Cotham, in Lincolnshire, is to see that there is more
    order in the singing of the novices. This House has grown very lax. The
    kinsfolk of the Sisters were no longer to be admitted; the Chaplain was
    not to be allowed the key of the church; the Lord of Misrule was not to
    be admitted at Christmas. Then, some of the Sisters had been allowed to
    go out into the world under pretence of pilgrimage, which license had
    caused great scandals. Henceforth they were not to be allowed out of
    the House for the night, nor out of the House at all unless accompanied
    by a devout Sister. Again, the Sisters had been allowed to go on visits
    to Thornton, Newsome, Hull (where there were other nunneries), and the
    Bishop speaks strongly of the reproach, rebuke, and shame which the
    rumours of their conduct had brought upon them. This House is the worst
    case of the four. Certain persons named are absolutely forbidden within
    the walls. Sir John Warde, Sir Richard Calverley, Sir William Johnson,
    the Parson of Skotton, and Sir William Sele, are those who have brought
    upon themselves by their misconduct this prohibition. Lastly, since the
    House had been reduced to miserable poverty, the Prioress must diminish
    her servants, grant no more corrodies, sell no more plate, and get the
    necessary repairs effected as speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>The last of the charges is one to the Abbot of Missenden, in
    Buckinghamshire. This House, also, has fallen into poverty; there must
    be a diminished number of servants and a simpler table; there must
    be no more granting of corrodies; the House must be put into repair.
    There was no school for the novices; a man learned in grammar must be
    appointed at once; the boys must be kept apart; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> future the monks
    must not be allowed to wander about outside, day and night, as had been
    the case. And no women were to be admitted either by day or by night.
    John Compton was to be turned out of the monastery at once—he was
    probably the steward; and Dom John Slithurst was to be put in prison
    and kept there.</p>

  <p>These accounts indicate very clearly the decay of discipline in the
    Houses. The Prioress eats and drinks with her steward; the Sisters
    entertain their kinsfolk within the walls; the church plate is sold to
    pay debts; the Sisters get outside on any pretext—then come scandals.
    Certain persons are so much mixed up with these scandals that they must
    never be allowed within the House at all; the Sisters adopt as much of
    the fashions of the world as they can; they shirk the services; they
    relieve the monotony of their lives by going on pilgrimages. As to the
    monks they get out alone, all night long. What scandals made the Bishop
    so determined upon keeping women out of the House altogether? And
    what had Dom Slithurst done, more than his fellows, that he was to be
    clapped into prison and kept there?</p>

  <p>It will be replied that these are all Houses in the country. That is
    quite true; yet I think that, considering the attacks on the Religious;
    the decay of the Friars; the withdrawal of bequests from monks and
    friars alike,—the London Houses must have been open at least to
    charges of laxity; and I would not press against them anything more
    severe. In the admonition of the Dean of St. Paul’s to the Nuns of
    St. Helen’s, laxity, not vice, was the principal complaint. Those
    who believe that graver charges might be brought may read the famous
    accusation against the Abbot of St. Albans—a thing, to my mind,
    impossible to get over. True, St. Albans is not London, which is a
    saving clause.</p>

  <p>Enough about the condition of the Houses and the morality of the
    Religious. I hear certain whispers where men congregate: they
    murmur—<i>tacenda</i>. I have no proof that they are true; but I understand
    that the holiness of the Religious is no longer accepted as a matter of
    course; it is enough for one that this is so. The work of the Houses
    is done when the people no longer desire the prayers of brethren
    <i>inclusi</i>, and sisters immured; and no longer expect the pristine
    devotion of the Friars.</p>

  <p>The suppression of the Religious Houses and its immediate effects in
    London are passed over by Stow, in his <i>Survey</i>, with great brevity.
    It is a pity; we should like so much to have a clear understanding of
    how the people at large received these measures. Now this historian was
    born in 1525; he could remember, therefore, not only the Dissolution,
    but also the condition of the City under the old <i>régime</i>. It is much
    to be lamented, further, that though he could find time and space
    to give whole pages to the Coronation of Anne Boleyn, he could not
    give more than a brief note on the suppression of one House after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
    another. He remembered the Franciscans going in and about everywhere
    in their grey gowns; the Dominicans in black; the Carmelites in white;
    he remembered the riding apparel of the monks; he remembered—he
    notices, in fact—the hospitality of the richer houses; he remembered
    the stately churches towering above the humble parish churches, as
    Westminster above St. Margaret’s; St. Augustine’s over Peter le Poor;
    the Holy Trinity over St. Catherine Cree; their peals of bells;
    their organs; their treasures of gold and silver plate; their church
    furniture, sumptuous with cloth of gold and velvet. He remembered the
    splendour, wealth, authority, and power of the old ecclesiastics. Their
    authority seemed rooted in the solid rock, never to be destroyed; and
    he remembered how this substantial ecclesiastical structure vanished
    at a word, at a touch, leaving behind it nothing but ruined cloisters;
    churches desecrated; carvings and marbles broken up. In his old age he
    sat alone and marvelled over these things. But he spoke not. Perhaps it
    was dangerous, even for a historian, to speak—Stow had already been
    accused of being a favourer, at least, of the old Order; regrets were
    accounted traitorous; sympathy with the outcast monk was heresy—or,
    which was as dangerous, was <i>lèse Majesté</i>. Not every one desired
    the crown of martyrdom: to most people it was disagreeable to be
    burned—one would avoid this method of extinction if possible; almost
    as disagreeable was it to be dragged on a hurdle, half hanged, cut
    down, and then quartered. So Stow wrote nothing about the old time as
    compared with that which followed.</p>

  <p>In a single passage, however, Stow does allow us to understand
    something of his opinion as to the whole business. No doubt many people
    looked about for some mark of the Divine displeasure upon those who
    took an active part in the Dissolution. To this day, certain persons
    whisper about the families which succeeded to the monastic houses; if
    anything happens to them it is put down to the vengeance which must
    be expected to follow upon the sacrilegious occupation of monastic
    property; nothing is said, of course, as to the long prosperity which
    has attended most of the families which still occupy the old monastic
    lands.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“About such time as Cardinall Wolsey was determined to erect
      his new Colledges in Oxford and Ipswich, he obtayned licence
      and authoritie of Pope Clement the Seventh to suppresse about
      the number of fortie Monasteries of good fame, and bountifull
      hospitalitie, wherin the King bearing with all his doings, neyther
      Bishop nor temporall Lorde in this Realme durst saye any worde to
      the contrarie.</p>

    <p>In the executing of this business, five persons were his chiefe
      instruments, who on a time made a demaunde to the Prior and
      Convent of the Monasterie of Daintrie, for occupying of certayne
      of theyr groundes, but the Monkes refusing to satisfie their
      requests, streightway they picked a quarrel agaynst the house,
      and gave information to the Cardinall agaynste them, who taking a
      small occasion, commaunded the house to bee dissolved, and to bee
      converted to hys new Colledge, but of thys irreligious robberie,
      done of no conscience, but to patch up pride, whiche private wealth
      coulde not furnishe, what punishmente hath since ensued at God’s
      hande (sayeth myne Author) partly ourselves have seene, for of
      those fyve persons, two fell at discorde betweene themselves, and
      the one slewe the other, for the which the survivor was hanged;
      the thirde drowned himselfe in a well; the fourth beeing well
      knowne, and valued worth two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> hundred pounde, became in three
      yeares so poore, that hee begged to hys dying day; and the fifth
      called Doctor Allane, beeyng chiefe executor of these doyngs, was
      cruelly maymed in Irelande, even at suche tyme as hee was a Bishop;
      the Cardinall falling after into the King’s greevous displeasure,
      was deposed, and dyed miserably; the Colledges whiche hee meante
      to have made so glorious a building, came never to good effect;
      and Pope Clement himselve, by whose authoritie these houses were
      throwne downe to the ground was after enclosed in a dangerous siege
      within the Castell of Saint Angell in Rome by the Emperialles; the
      Citie of Rome was pitifully sacked; and himselfe narrowly escaped
      with his life.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have repeatedly spoken of the falling off in bequests to the various
    Religious Orders during the hundred years preceding the Reformation.
    The fact, indeed, seems to be most important in considering the
    attitude of the citizens. That it is a fact may be proved by the
    following table, compiled from the <i>Calendar of Wills</i>. I have already
    made some extracts from the Wills in proof of the change of popular
    opinion in this respect; this table considers the fact from another
    point of view.</p>

  <p>Of course we have not, in these pages, all the Wills, nor anything
    more than a small fraction of the Wills made by the Citizens during
    the centuries covered by the contents of these two volumes. But they
    may be taken as representative wills, in whatever manner they present
    contemporary opinion. Now, as regards bequests to Religious Houses, I
    have made the following analysis. I take three periods. (1) from 1250
    to 1350; (2) from 1350 to 1450; (3) from 1450 to the Dissolution, say
    1538; covering nearly three centuries. During these three periods the
    following is the number of bequests:—</p>

  <p>These figures show most unmistakably that the monastic life was no
    longer regarded as it had been by the people of London. By the friars
    especially, <i>i.e.</i> by those who could read the signs of the time, it
    must have been understood that the end was very near. Not the alleged
    immorality of the Religious, but the decay of their numbers, the
    wasting of their property, the withdrawal of support by the laity,
    might have warned those under vows that a change was nigh at hand. I do
    not suppose that many of them heard this warning. Who could believe,
    standing in the great church, glittering with lights, with gold and
    silver, rich with colour, splendid with carved work, that the axe was
    already laid to the root?</p>

  <p>The people of London were not, it is true, consulted. Henry was not
    the kind of man to consult the illiterate on points of Theology or
    Spiritual Government. They were, however, filled with a vague unrest
    of new ideas; we know not what survivals of the old Lollardry lingered
    and were whispered about, or spoken openly; we know not how widely the
    ballads and satirical verses against monks and friars were repeated
    and sung and made the subject of merriment in the taverns. We do know,
    however, that the King ordered and that the people of London obeyed.
    I think it incredible that even the most masterful of English kings
    should have dared to force changes so radical upon an unwilling city.
    London was never remarkable for meekness, and in matters religious was
    never uncertain. The King must have known that the people of London,
    at least, would be with him. London, therefore, obeyed; the people
    looked on while the Pope of Rome vanished; they made no protest when
    they saw Monks, Nuns, and Friars turned out of doors and their Houses
    closed; they looked on without a murmur even when the Carthusians
    were dragged to a horrible doom. Was this callousness? Was it fear?
    Was it acquiescence in the Revolution, with the hope of larger things
    to follow? For my own part, looking at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> attitude of the citizens
    during the successive reigns of Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, I
    think there can be no doubt as to the general opinion at the time, and
    that it was from the outset in favour of the Dissolution of the Houses
    and the Dispersion of the Religious; in favour of denying the authority
    of the Pope; eager for the free readings of the Holy Scriptures in the
    vulgar tongue and for the right of that private interpretation which
    seems so easy to the illiterate. As regards ritual, the changes, as
    will be explained later, were gradual; the introduction of distinctive
    Protestant doctrine was not brought about in a day; the genesis of the
    Puritanic spirit does not belong to the Revolution under Henry.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Let us endeavour to realise something of the extraordinary change which
    the Suppression of the Houses brought about in London. Fortunately the
    work was carried on by successive Acts, covering a period of fifteen
    years or so; it was not until 1548, for instance, that the whole of the
    chantries, colleges, etc., were suppressed.</p>

  <p>The point of departure is, naturally, the expulsion and the dispersion
    of the Religious of all Orders. At this point most historians stop. Yet
    this was only the beginning.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

  <p>Consider, then, the number of those turned out of the London Houses.
    We may arrive at an approximation of the number by the following
    considerations. There were 202 Houses, not counting Friaries, dissolved
    in 1538–1540.</p>

  <p>They contained, in all, 3221 Monks and Canons. This gives an average of
    16 Brethren to each House. Now there were in London some twenty Houses
    great and small—say from St. Peter’s, Westminster, to Jesus Commons.
    In the same proportion there would thus be 300 Monks and Canons. In the
    same proportion, also, there would be about a fourth of that number of
    Nuns. Now, these monks and nuns were not sent out into a cold world
    empty-handed. Not at all. They received pensions. The nuns of St.
    Helen’s, for instance, received pensions of £2:14:4 each. The chantry
    priests of the same place, whose stipends had been £6:13:4 and £7
    respectively, obtained pensions of £5 each. We must, in fact, put aside
    altogether the generally received notion of the Dissolution as an Act
    which drove thousands of holy men and women out of their homes—abodes
    of piety and virtue—to starve. There was no starvation at all: the
    pensions though small were intended to be sufficient; we have therefore
    the fact that some 400 Religious of London were made to lay down the
    habit of their Profession and to go forth into the world on pensions
    large enough to maintain them. What became of them? Many of the older
    monks and nuns doubtless felt acutely the change of habit; the loss of
    the former life—its quiet, its self-centred interests, its community;
    some of the younger men, we cannot doubt, willingly turned themselves
    to secular pursuits; some lived quietly, keeping up privately, two or
    three together, some manner of religious life; some were concealed
    in the country and a few, perhaps, in town, and led the life of the
    Rule in a clandestine manner; some, again, the restraint of their vows
    being withdrawn, ran into excesses and fell into the mire; some haunted
    taverns, to the disgrace of their former calling. But of suffering or
    privation I cannot discover that there was much, if any, either for
    monks or nuns. It is pretended that the pensions were irregularly paid.
    The evidence seems to me insufficient; in regard to the nuns of St.
    Helen’s, we have positive evidence pointing in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>The greatest sufferers were, as we have seen, the friars. For them
    there was no pity; for them there were no pensions; no one believed
    in them any longer; their day was done. There appeared, a short time
    ago, a book written by one who had been for twelve years a friar:
    he came out of the House; he laid down his frock and renounced his
    vows; and he wrote a book in which he described the life of his late
    brethren. It is not an exaggerated or an ill-natured book; it is simply
    a plain statement of the manner of life led by the friars of these
    days. Looking through its pages one begins unconsciously to consider
    the friars of the early sixteenth century—the friars in their last
    days—by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> light of this revelation. Now the modern friar is a man
    of some education and some culture. Take away his education and his
    culture in order to get at the friar of the Tudor time. Place him in a
    time much rougher and coarser in manners; give him nothing to do: no
    work either of mental or physical kind; and to the general futility
    and unreality of life in a modern friary add the temptations, almost
    irresistible to the uneducated mind of the ordinary friar, of the world
    around him. In this way one may succeed, perhaps, in understanding the
    reasons for the unpopularity of the friars.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_123"><img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="600" height="399" alt="" /></a>

      From an engraving by G. Collins.  &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Rischgitz’ Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It is generally stated that riches flowed in upon the friars as a
    consequence of the respect in which they were held. That is not the
    case: they were never rich. They owned a few houses built within the
    limits of their own precinct, the rent of which went to maintain the
    fabric of the church, and the service. For themselves the friars
    possessed no great buildings, except the Church, the Library, and the
    Hall: and they lived on charity at the end of their time as at the
    beginning. Wyclyf makes much of their churches. “Freres bylden mony
    grete churches and costily houses, and cloystris as hit were castels
    and that withoute nede. Grete houses make not men holy, and onely by
    holiness is God wel served.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

  <p>The friars were not rich, but they were proud: they arrogated power and
    sanctity for their very robe. Those who died in the Franciscan habit
    could never, they said, be carried away by the devil. Walsingham, who
    had, perhaps, the jealousy of a monk, thus wrote of them:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The friars, unmindful of their profession, have even forgotten
      to what end their Orders were instituted; for the holy men their
      lawgivers desired them to be poor and free of all kind of temporal
      possessions, that they should not have anything which they might
      fear to lose on account of saying the truth. But now they are
      envious of possessors, approve the crimes of the great, induce
      the commonalty into error, and praise the sins of both; and with
      the intent of acquiring possessions, they who had renounced
      possessions, with the intent of gathering money, they who had sworn
      to persevere in poverty, call good evil and evil good, leading
      astray princes by adulation, the people by lies, and drawing both
      with themselves out of the straight path.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They disappeared. What became of them? It is impossible to say. Some
    of the Sisters went to Flanders; some of those who were in priests’
    orders obtained benefices; some took up honest work; for many, work was
    impossible. If a man gets to thirty or so without doing any work, it
    becomes impossible that he should ever do any work.</p>

  <p>The Brethren, however, were not the only people who lived upon
    the revenues of the House. Every Monastic Foundation had its own
    establishment and was complete in itself. Of course, the superfluity
    of officers and the general waste of work were, from a modern point of
    view, deplorable. Every House had its mill, its brewery, its bakery,
    its still-rooms, its gardens, orchards, fish-ponds, vineyards; its
    servants of all kinds, including bailiffs, serjeants, scriveners,
    illuminators, carvers, gilders, singing men, singing schools, huntsmen,
    farmers, carpenters, plumbers, gardeners, agriculturists, sextons,
    gate-porters, rent-collectors, lawyers, stewards, and one knows not
    what besides. When the House was closed all these people were turned
    adrift, certainly, without pensions. Thousands of families, for these
    people were not under vows and were married, were suddenly deprived of
    their means of livelihood. What could they do? The ordinary craftsmen
    would make shift: their Companies helped them; but the better sort,
    the scriveners, limners, illuminators, painters, carvers, gilders; the
    bailiffs, lawyers, stewards,—what could they do? For fifteen years
    London was flooded with the people of the monasteries turned adrift to
    find a means of living; they were not people who swelled the ranks of
    the vagabond and the masterless; they were respectable and honest folk.
    Their struggles and their sufferings, if we could get at them, must
    have been very real and, in many cases, very terrible.</p>

  <p>There were, next, the people who lived by the making and selling
    of things no longer wanted under the new order. There were the
    makers of ecclesiastical vestments and robes; altar cloths; wax
    tapers; instruments required in the celebration of Mass; crosses and
    crucifixes; beads, reliquaries, images, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> the “properties”
    required for the old Faith. Also all those who sold tapers, beads,
    crosses, images, relics, books of hours, mass books, censers and
    every kind of church vessel. One has only to look at the shops in the
    vicinity of a French cathedral to understand the extent of the business
    when not a single cathedral, but a hundred and fifty parish churches,
    and monastic chapels, had to be provided for, and when all the people,
    with one consent, acquiesced in the doctrines, and practised the ritual
    of the Church.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All these people, thus deprived of their livelihood, were skilled
    craftsmen. When their occupation was gone, when embroidered
    altar-cloths, copes and vestments stiff with cloth of gold, carven
    images, sacred pictures, beads and crosses and crucifixes, were no
    longer wanted, what could they do? If, at the present day, any single
    branch of industry is suddenly destroyed, what happens? It is too late
    for the people concerned to learn another trade. What happened to these
    unfortunates it is impossible to guess. One thing we know, namely, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    general terms, that London was in a miserable condition for a quarter
    of a century after the Dissolution of the Houses; and we may fairly
    conclude that not bad trade alone, but also the great number of poor
    and forlorn creatures who had been hurled by the Reformation from
    comfort to penury, was one cause of the depression.</p>

  <p>Or, if we consider the immediate external effects of the Suppression;
    think of the unwonted silence, when all the bells of all the Monastic
    Houses were taken down: instead of the melodious pealing from forty
    chapels, there was left only the sorry tinkle of the parish bell.</p>

  <p>From the streets disappeared all the friars: those of St. Francis,
    of St. Dominic, of St. Augustine, the Carmelites, and those with the
    Iron Cross. The old familiar figures had been diminishing in numbers,
    but they were still visible when the end came: still they went about,
    opening their money-boxes in the shops, and finding nothing. Afterwards
    one met, flitting along the streets, stray and forlorn figures clad
    like craftsmen, but knowing no craft; sturdy beggars who would not
    work; men and women turned out into the stony-hearted streets, filled
    with rage and bitterness; looking always for the restoration of the
    old Order and their own return to the quiet house of ease and comfort.
    Gone, too, were the servants of the Houses; they had been known by the
    badge upon their shoulders; gone was the vast army of chantry priests,
    subdeacons, and ecclesiastics, with all the minor Orders. When Queen
    Mary restored the ancient Faith the priests appeared again, leaping
    out from unknown dens and secret places, ready to resume suddenly the
    restored service before the newly adorned altar. And as London always
    attracted the masterless and the vagabond and the criminal, so from
    all parts of England flocked to the City those whom the Reformation
    had sent out homeless and penniless. The clergy, for their part, lost
    the greater part of their fees. The baptisms, marriages, and funerals,
    it is true, continued, but the fees for masses to be said for the
    dead—the most important part of the fees—the endowments of chantries,
    post obits, and memorial days, were all swept away. There were many
    chantry priests in every parish church. Why, only a few years before
    the Reformation, on the death of Lady Jane Seymour, Sir Richard Gresham
    ordered 1200 masses to be sung in the City churches for the repose of
    her soul. And when prayers for the dead were forbidden, and what had
    been an aristocratic Heaven, open especially to the rich because they
    could buy their entrance by masses, became a democratic Heaven, open
    to the poor and lowly as much as to the high and mighty, the loss to
    the clergy from this source was very great. There was also another
    loss in the abolition of pilgrimage, and another in the abolition of
    confession, penance, and extreme unction.</p>

  <p>As for the people, they had their losses to deplore as well as their
    gains to rejoice over. They were deprived, for instance, of the most
    splendid and gorgeous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> spectacle open to them, the services of the
    Church with the rolling music of the organ, the singing of the choir,
    the chanting of the priests; with the illumination of the altar; the
    fragrance of the incense; the pictures on the wall; the brilliant side
    chapels; the many votive candles; the sculptured saints; and all that
    appealed to the eye and to the ear. That service had been performed
    by moving figures, they seemed not men, in wondrous robes set off
    by the bright lights. It was a service at which the hearts of men
    and women with imagination were daily, keenly, sincerely moved and
    led heavenward. All this they had to give up. In its place they were
    offered a cold and quiet service with a sermon an hour long, appealing
    to their reason and bidding them base their faith on logic and argument
    instead of the authority and the Voice of the Church, inviting them to
    trust in right doctrine rather than in the Fold of Christ. The service
    had been the chief instructor in art, music, and æsthetics. When it was
    gone what had they left? There were no more pictures for the people;
    there was no more grand and solemn music for them; only the tinkling
    of the mandoline in the tavern, or the “noise” of the whifflers who
    marched before a prisoner; there was nothing else for them. Mary’s
    martyrs made them hate the name of Catholic; they pelted her chaplains
    in the street; they hung up a dog, head shorn, to mock the tonsure;
    they hung up a cat with a wafer in its paws to mock the Elevation
    of the Host. Yet though they were no longer Catholics it cannot be
    maintained that they had got very far in Protestantism.</p>

  <p>Some of the ancient forms remained: it still continued the duty of
    every Christian, as it has always been the duty of every follower
    of the Roman Church, to attend service on Sunday morning, and to
    communicate on the great festivals of Easter, Christmas, Trinity,
    and Whit Sunday. The fast days remained: no flesh could be sold; the
    butchers’ shops were closed; none could be eaten on Fridays or in Lent;
    there were some who followed the ancient austerities so far as to
    fast on Wednesday as well. All classes, high and low, rich and poor,
    were constantly engaged in reading the New Testament for proofs of
    new doctrine, and the Old Testament for examples and for warnings. In
    every ale-house the men wrangled on points of doctrine over their pots;
    the women in the doorways discussed obscure points in the teaching of
    St. Paul; there were none so ignorant as not to be able to formulate
    a whole body of doctrines; in every barber’s shop there was a Bible;
    already men had begun to set up strange and absurd teachings, in their
    ignorant and fond attempts to discern the Truth in a weak translation;
    already some had begun to go about in sad-coloured garments, without
    ornament, colour, or decoration, even with texts ostentatiously bound
    round their hats or their sleeves, like the phylacteries of the
    Pharisees.</p>

  <p>In London the better sort of people towards the end of the century
    became infected with Puritanism. Puritans were known by their outward
    and visible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> signs: they wore texts on their arms; they hated starch
    and had limp cuffs; they wore no hatbands; they would not curl their
    hair, but carried it lank; those who were shopkeepers always had
    a Bible open on the counter; they hated the theatre and all other
    amusements; in church they would have no organ; they used strange
    words, calling, for instance, godfather and godmother “witnesses”; they
    spoke of Christ-tide instead of Christmas; whole trades in London went
    “solid” for Puritanism, <i>e.g.</i> the feathermen of Blackfriars; they
    were intolerant and fanatic; they desired above all things to abolish
    Episcopacy. They showed their opinions by their manner of singing,
    which was without the accompaniment of organs, and by slowly drawling
    their words. The Puritans would not greatly care for irreverence in St.
    Paul’s: they gave no reverence to a consecrated place; yet they went to
    church in order to worship and to hear godly sermons. Therefore they
    could not look on unmoved when they saw St. Paul’s crowded with people
    who went there in order to transact business, to buy and sell, to talk,
    to quarrel, to fight, to make assignations or to keep them, to display
    fine dress, to be hired in service.</p>

  <p>To a certain class, the larger class, otherwise the thing would have
    been impossible; these changes were welcomed with the greatest joy
    because they declared and emphasised the revolution of religious
    thought. For the majority the pendulum had swung round from the faith
    and trust in the Fold of the Church, to the sense of individual
    responsibility. The pendulum is always swinging backwards and
    forwards. In our own time we have witnessed a partial return to the
    belief in a Fold. The cold service with its long sermon of doctrine;
    the private study of the Scriptures; the exercise of individual
    judgment, free though unlettered, upon points of doubt and apparent
    contradiction;—all formed part of the same movement and appealed to
    the majority.</p>

  <p>At the same time there was another section to whom these things were
    hateful and horrible and blasphemous. This was the class which was
    ready to forget the old grievances, the intolerable burden of Church
    property; the multitudes who lived in sloth, as it appeared; the wide
    difference between practice and profession; and thought only, as so
    many at the present day think, of the haven of safety promised to the
    faithful; the beauty, splendour, and stateliness of the service; the
    ecstasy of the believer; the yielding of spirit before the Ineffable
    Presence; the visible power and authority of the Roman Catholic Church.
    These people looked and prayed daily for a return of the old Faith;
    they were recusants under Elizabeth; they concealed the priests who
    came over to concoct their conspiracies; they were Romanists first and
    Englishmen next, until the horrors of the persecution in Flanders, of
    the massacres in France, and the designs of the Spaniards upon England,
    made them Englishmen first and Catholics next.</p>

    Palace Library, which probably belonged to the Queen herself.</div>

  <p>An irreparable loss to the world was the wholesale destruction of the
    libraries. Printing, an invention of no longer standing than fifty
    years, had as yet produced comparatively few books. When, for instance,
    the learned Anthony Brockby had written his book <i>Ad Fratres</i> against
    the King’s Supremacy, he did not get it printed, but had a duplicate
    copy made, which he presented to the Franciscans, his brothers. By
    far the greater part of theology, philosophy, science, and literature
    remained in MS., and these MSS. formed the Monastic Libraries. When
    the Houses were suppressed, those who obtained them as a gift from
    the King for the most part cared nothing about the books: they were
    dispersed without any consideration for their use or value; if they
    were well bound, the covers were pulled off and the books thrown away,
    or turned into waste paper. Thus John Bale writes (<i>Antiq. English
      Franciscans</i>):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Covetousness was at that time so busy about private interest, that
      public wealth was not anywhere regarded. A number of them which
      purchased those superstitious Mansions reserved of those Library
      Books some to serve their Jakes, some to scowr their candlesticks,
      and some to rub their Boots, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> some they sold the Grocers and
      Soap sellers, and some they sent over sea to the Bookbinders:
      not in small number, but, at times, whole ships full. Yea, the
      Universities of this Realm are not all clear in this Fact; but
      cursed is the belly which seeks to be fed with so ungodly gains,
      and so deeply shameth his natural country. I know a Merchant man
      (which shall at this time be nameless) that bought the Contents of
      two noble Libraries for forty shillings price; a shame it is to be
      spoken. This stuff hath he occupied, instead of grey paper, by the
      space of more than these ten years, and yet he hath store enough
      for as many years to come. A prodigious example is this, and to be
      abhorred of all men which love their nation as they should do. Yea,
      what may bring our realm to more shame and rebuke than to have it
      noised abroad that we are despisers of learning? I judge this to be
      true, and utter it with heaviness, that neither the Britons under
      the Romans and Saxons, nor yet the English people under the Danes
      and Normans had ever such damage of their learned Monuments as we
      have seen in our time. Our posterity may well curse this wicked
      fact of our age, this unreasonable spoil of England’s most noble
      Antiquities.”... “How many admirable manuscripts of the Fathers,
      Schoolmen, and Commentators were destroyed by this means? What
      number of historians of all ages and Countries? The Holy Scriptures
      themselves, as much as these Gospellers pretended to regard them,
      underwent the fate of the rest. If a Book had a cross on it it
      was condemned for Popery, and those with lines and circles were
      interpreted the Black Art and destroyed for Conjuring. And thus, as
      Fuller goes on, Divinity was profaned, Mathematicks suffered for
      Corespondence with Evil Spirits, Physick was maimed, and a Riot
      committed on the Law itself.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One change, one result, of the Suppression, everybody can understand.
    This was the closing of the Hospitals. London was full of Hospitals,
    but they were Religious Houses. St. Bartholomew’s, attached to the
    Priory; St. Thomas’, Southwark; St. Mary Spital; Elsing Spital for the
    blind; St. Mary of Bethlehem for the insane; the House on Tower Hill
    also for the insane; the House of St. Augustine Papey for old priests;
    the Infirmary in every Monastic House;—all these provided for the sick
    poor. I have no doubt, though on the subject I have no information,
    that the Companies, which certainly took care of their sick and their
    infirm, must have done so through the existing Hospitals. When the
    Houses were closed, what became of the sick? It is commonly believed
    that they were turned into the street, no one caring for them. This
    was certainly not the case. The Companies cared for their own; the
    City cared for its freemen and their families; would the City, which
    maintained a debtors’ prison for its freemen, so that they should not
    be confined with the general herd, suffer its sick and poor to starve?
    There was a residuum of those who were not free, namely, the vagabonds
    and masterless men and women. For them there was a time of great
    misery; when they were ill there was no one to visit them; no hospital
    where they might be taken; no hands to minister and alleviate; no voice
    to console and to fortify. And we know nothing, and cannot estimate the
    suffering because there were no journalists to publish the things they
    saw; and the sick and poor lay unheeded and starved, and died unknown
    and uncared for in the dirt and misery of the Tudor slum.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt, also, that the open house kept by such a monastery
    as the Holy Trinity, where the poor received every day the broken meat
    and a great deal more, was greatly missed and deplored by the whole
    company of the masterless. What with daily open house at the greater
    monasteries, the broken meats of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> smaller, the doles and charities
    of the parish, the “mind days” with their loaves and gifts to the
    poor, bequeathed by rich citizens, a family which objected to work
    might rub along in solid and well-fed comfort all the year round. And
    this resource, looked upon as certain and unfailing like a perennial
    spring, was suddenly stopped. Then all these people had to work, or
    to beg, or to rob. The streets became pestered with sturdy beggars:
    the by-places of Elizabethan Literature present most vivid pictures of
    the companies of beggars, impostors, rogues and vagabonds. They were
    the people whom the monks and nuns had fed without asking questions;
    the folk who would not work; the people turned out of the monasteries;
    ex-friars; ex-chantry priests; former makers of images, crucifixes,
    beads, candlesticks and the rest: these were the people who felt most
    bitterly the abolition of indiscriminate charity and the cruel choice
    offered them under the new order of work; mendicancy with the whip, or
    crime with the gallows.</p>

  <p>Out of all these evils and sufferings was born, like a sweet flower on
    a heap of rubbish, the Spirit of modern Charity.</p>

  <p>The Church had taken over to herself the whole of Mediæval charity. Did
    a citizen desire to help the poor, he gave money for the purpose to the
    Church. If a poor man wanted help, it was not to a merchant that he
    went, but to a monastery.</p>

  <p>For charity, that is, for pity, for almsgiving, the world has always
    felt the most profound respect. The most popular of mediæval saints was
    the hard and austere Bishop of whom the world remembered that he had
    once divided his cloak with a beggar. There were six churches dedicated
    to St. Martin in the City of London alone.</p>

  <p>And when the friars first came over, and men, wondering, saw that they
    did not lock themselves up in their cloister to pray for the world
    like the other Religious, but that they went about among the people
    ministering, comforting, preaching, consoling; that they found no den
    too revolting, no disease too loathsome, no criminal too base, for
    their ministrations; then, indeed, there was an outburst of gratitude,
    of joy, of respect, of awe for men so saintly. They were considered the
    veritable children of God.</p>

  <p>But it was not to be thought that the poor sinners outside the
    monastery should imitate their example. Nay, St. Francis, their
    founder, had himself separated his Order from the world, they were
    called out from the rest of humanity, they were kept separate by
    vows of celibacy, poverty, obedience. Modern charity as yet did not
    exist, as we now understand it, only the respect for charity as an
    ecclesiastical institution.</p>

  <p>I believe that the early followers of St. Francis perceived the weak
    point of this separation from the world. We can hear one wiser than
    the rest saying, “There is danger that the early zeal may decline. All
    things human have in them the germs of decay; if there comes a time
    when our brethren shrink from the task they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> undertaken, if their
    vows become a sham, their prayers a form, their work a pretence and
    a profession, then it would have been better for the world had St.
    Francis never existed, because we shall have taken from the layman the
    duty of personal service and killed it by our own neglect.”</p>

  <p>To meet this danger, not to take renunciation and self-sacrifice wholly
    out of the world, they created another Order, that called the <i>Fratres
      de Saccâ</i>. This Order contained men and women of the world, married
    men and married women; they were allowed to go about their daily work;
    those who were single were not forbidden to marry; they took vows, but
    not those of celibacy nor of poverty.</p>

  <p>When the Houses were suppressed, all the institutions which they had
    supported were suppressed as well. Yet it did not immediately occur
    to the people that the burden of the poor, which they had long since
    willingly laid upon the Church, was now laid upon themselves. When
    the City took over the House of the Grey Friars; the House of St.
    Bartholomew; the House of St. Mary Bethlehem; the Palace of Bridewell;
    the House of St. Thomas,—it seemed to take the place of the Church
    and to attempt, by way of taxation, all that the Monastic Houses had
    tried, or professed, to do from their own resources. We hear of sundry
    collections for the poor; we do not hear of work among the poor, or of
    responsibility for the poor, for a hundred years and more after the
    Reformation.</p>

  <p>I am not, happily, called upon in this place to attack, or to defend,
    the Dissolution. I have only to consider its effect upon London. And
    as regards the London Houses, I repeat, I can find no scandals. The
    judgment of the people, though that was not asked or regarded, seems to
    have arrived at a very clear understanding as to the actual spiritual
    value, apart from any pretension or profession, of the life of
    seclusion and celibacy. It was a very low estimate. On the other hand,
    the City does not seem to have been openly hostile to the Religious.
    They were an institution; these holy men were their own kin; the
    Monastic Houses were a part of the daily life.</p>

  <p>There were violent things published against monks and friars at this
    time, but they were written by vehement partisans and were forced
    upon the people. For example, the work of Barnabe Googe with his
    <i>Popish Kingdom</i>. Had there been any active hatred against them it
    would have shown itself by the acts and deeds of the ’prentices, who
    always reflected, roughly but surely, the direction of the current
    of contemporary opinion. Such slight indications of feeling on the
    subject as are afforded by the literature in the next generation point
    to reverence as regards the nuns; while as regards monks and friars
    they are clean forgotten—a sure sign that they were not very actively
    hated. At the same time it does seem most remarkable that the treatment
    of the Carthusians, who must have been regarded as innocent victims and
    martyrs, unless they were represented as political traitors, should not
    have excited any popular indignation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> One can only suppose that the
    spectacle of a prisoner drawn on a hurdle, hanged, and quartered, was
    so familiar, that people hardly troubled to ask who the sufferer was,
    or for what crime he suffered.</p>

  <p>Let us now pass on to speak of certain Martyrs and Confessors. It is by
    this time needless to point out that the constancy shown by a Ridley
    and a Latimer for the Protestant form of doctrine was fully equalled
    by that of those who passed through the way of fire for the ancient
    faith. There was, however, this difference, that the Catholic martyrs
    were monks, priests, and men of mark like Fisher and More, while the
    Protestants included a vast number of men and women from the lower
    ranks—from the uneducated, who yet dared to hold a belief of their own
    based, as they thought, on private judgment,—really on the training of
    the sermons that they had heard.</p>

  <p>The case of Dr. Forest, Confessor to Queen Katherine, must not be
    forgotten when one speaks of the martyrs of this time. Forest, an
    old man, was committed to gaol, where he lay for two years among the
    common malefactors, because he refused to acknowledge the supremacy of
    the King. After two years of Newgate, two years in a close, stifling,
    and noisome prison, the venerable priest was informed that he was to
    be hanged over a fire and so slowly done to death. No more terrible
    form of death was known in England, where the horrors of the French
    and German capital punishments were never practised. It was the same
    punishment as had been meted out to Oldcastle, and it was inflicted
    on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> Forest for the same reason: to show the hatred and abhorrence of
    the judges for the doctrines he taught. When the unfortunate Katherine
    heard of the sentence she wrote to him. The letter, too long for
    reproduction in these pages, together with Forest’s reply, may be found
    in <i>The Antiquities of the English Franciscans</i>: they are probably
    genuine and are very pitiful. The Queen, however, was spared the misery
    of hearing of her Confessor’s torturing death: he was respited and
    continued to lie in prison. Two years after the Queen’s death, and when
    he had been confined in Newgate for four years, Forest was brought out
    for execution.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd of May 1518 they placed the old man on a sledge and dragged
    him from Newgate to Smithfield, where he was hung in chains from a
    gallows over a fire. This was the most terrible of all deaths. In
    ordinary cases, the sufferer, bound to a thick stake with iron chains,
    was enclosed up to the middle, and perhaps higher, with dry faggots: it
    would seem that the fierce flames enveloping the victim caused death by
    suffocation in a very few moments. Latimer, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> instance, died in this
    manner almost immediately; if, however, the flames were blown away, the
    lower parts of the body might be slowly burned before death ensued:
    this was the case with Ridley. When, however, the sufferer was simply
    dangled over a fire, the flames blown this way and that, the agony
    might last for hours.</p>

  <p>In the case of Forest, the bystanders took pity on the old man and
    threw the gallows into the fire, so that an end was soon made. “In
    what state,” asked Latimer before the fire was lit, “will you die?”
    Whereupon the old man replied in a loud voice: “If an angel should
    come down from heaven to teach men any other doctrine than what I have
    received and believed from my youth, I would not believe him; and if
    my body should be cut joint after joint, member after member, hanged,
    burned, or whatever pain might be done to me, yet would I never turn
    from my old profession.” A brave old man!</p>

  <p>After the Carthusians the principal sufferers seem to have been the
    Observant Friars, of whom a large number suffered for refusing to
    acknowledge the King’s supremacy. We may read in the <i>Antiquities of
      the English Franciscans</i> a great many stories of these sufferings. One
    hopes that there is exaggeration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> For some, according to this book,
    were carried about the country in chains; some were racked and then
    strangled; some were starved to death; miracles attended the death of
    some: the whole prison, in one case, became filled with a heavenly and
    miraculous light; and an earthquake, in another case, testified to the
    Divine displeasure at another martyrdom.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd day of June 1534, three days after the execution of the
    three Carthusians, Exmew, Middlemore, and Newdigate, was beheaded that
    illustrious Catholic martyr, John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, for
    maintaining the Pope’s supremacy; and a fortnight later, that still
    more illustrious martyr, Thomas More. The witty and pleasant manner of
    his conversation was kept up to the last. Grafton thus speaks of his
    last moments:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Besides his learning he had a great wit, and in talking verie
      pleasant and merie conceited, and that even to the last hower;
      insomuch that at hys comming to the Tower, one of the officers
      demanded his upper garment for his fee (meaning hys Gowne) and
      he aunswered, he should haue it, and toke him his cap, saying it
      was the uppermost garment that he had. Likewise even going to his
      death at the Tower gate a pore woman called to him and besought
      him to declare that he had certayn evidence of hers in the time
      that he was in office (which after he was apprehended she could
      not come by) and that he would intreat she might have them agayne,
      or else she was undone. He aunswered good woman have pacience a
      little while, for the King is so good unto me that even within
      this half houre he will discharge me of all businesses, and help
      thee himselfe. Also when he went up the stayres on the Scaffolde,
      he desired one of the Shriefes officers to give him his hand to
      help him up, and sayde, when I come downe agayne, let me shift for
      myself as well as I can. Also the hangman kneeled downe to him
      asking him forgivenesse of his death (as the manner is) to whome he
      sayde I forgive thee, but I promise thee that thou shalt never have
      honestie of the stryking of my head, my neck is so short. Also even
      when he should lay downe his head on the block, he having a great
      gray beard, striked out his beard and sayde to the hangman, I pray
      you let me lay my beard over the block least ye should cut it.”
      (<i>Chronicle of England</i>, Grafton, vol. ii. p. 454.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The martyrdom of the Carthusians was the most significant, the most
    revengeful, the most audacious act of the new Head of the Church, the
    Act by which he defied, once for all, the whole power of the Pope, of
    Spain, and even of France. The world trembled, people looked for some
    supernatural manifestation, some unmistakable sign of the Divine wrath:
    none came, and they understood that here was an act of open war, and
    that the Divine will as to the issue had not been pronounced.</p>

  <p>Let us pass to the Marian Persecution. I have called attention to the
    fact that the greater number of the martyrs belonged to the middle
    class and to the rank or status of craftsmen. Thus, Christopher Wade
    was a linen weaver; Thomas Wats a linen draper; John Warren was an
    upholsterer; John Ardeley was a husbandman; Robert Bromley was a
    grocer; Thomas Ormond was a fuller; Williams a weaver; Margery Polley
    widow of a craftsman; Dirick Carver a brewer; John Laneden a rustic;
    John Tudson an artificer; Joan Warne a maidservant. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>There were wives
    and widows among them, “simple women,” artificers and ’prentices,
    maid-servants and girls.</p>

  <p>It was the sight of their own people suffering a cruel death which made
    the name of Rome hateful and horrible for three hundred years and more.
    It was the sight of the constancy of the martyrs which laid the firm
    foundations of the Protestant Faith. For none of them flinched before
    the flames, none of them feared the pains which the Lord God in His
    mercy and wisdom had ordered them to endure for the sake of the Cause.
    What was to be expected when a shoemaker such as John Noyes could die
    triumphant and rejoicing?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On the next-day morning he was brought to the stake, where were
      ready against his coming the foresaid justice, master Thurston, one
      master Waller, then being under-sheriff, and master Thomas Lovel,
      being high-constable, as is before expressed; the which commanded
      men to make ready all things meet for that sinful purpose. Now the
      fire in most places of the street was put out, saving a smoke which
      was espied by the said Thomas Lovel proceeding from the top of a
      chimney, to which house the sheriff and Grannow his man went, and
      brake open the door, and thereby got fire, and brought the same to
      the place of execution. When John Noyes came to the place where
      he should be burnt, he kneeled down and said the 50th Psalm, with
      other prayers; and then they, making haste, bound him to the stake.
      And being bound, the said John Noyes said, ‘Fear not them that can
      kill the body, but fear him that can kill both body and soul, and
      cast it into everlasting fire.’</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

    <p>When he saw his sister weeping, and making moan for him, he bade
      her that she should not weep for him, but weep for her sins.</p>

    <p>Then one Nicholas Cadman, a valiant champion in the Pope’s affairs,
      brought a faggot and set against him; and the said John Noyes took
      up the faggot and kissed it, and said, ‘Blessed be the time that
      ever I was born to come to this.’</p>

    <p>Then he delivered his Psalter to the under-sheriff, desiring him to
      be good to his wife and children, and to deliver to her that same
      book; and the sheriff promised him that he would, notwithstanding
      he never as yet performed his promise. Then the said John Noyes
      said to the people, ‘They say, they can make God of a piece of
      bread; believe them not!’</p>

    <p>Then said he, ‘Good people, bear witness that I do believe to be
      saved by the merits and passion of Jesus Christ, and not by mine
      own deeds.’ And so the fire was kindled, and burnt about him. Then
      he said, ‘Lord have mercy upon me! Christ have mercy upon me! Son
      of David have mercy upon me!’</p>

    <p>And so he yielded up his life. And when his body was burned, they
      made a pit to bury the coals and ashes, and amongst the same they
      found one of his feet that was unburnt, whole up to the ankle, with
      the hose on; and that they buried with the rest.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Or, to take the case of Cicely Ormes. She was a very simple woman,
    the wife of a worsted weaver who lived in Norwich. She was present at
    the martyrdom of Simon Miller and Elizabeth Cooper, and there, being
    affected with their constancy, she declared that she would pledge them
    with the same cup from which they drank:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“She was burnt the 23d day of September, between seven and eight of
      the clock in the morning, the said two sheriffs being there, and of
      people to the number of two hundred. When she came to the stake,
      she kneeled down, and made her prayers to God; that being done, she
      rose up and said:—</p>

    <p>‘Good people! I believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the
      Holy Ghost, three persons and one God. This do I not, nor will I
      recant; but I recant utterly from the bottom of my heart the doings
      of the Pope of Rome, and all his popish priests and shavelings. I
      utterly refuse and never will have to do with them again, by God’s
      grace. And, good people! I would you should not report of me that
      I believe to be saved in that I offer myself here unto the death
      for the Lord’s cause, but I believe to be saved by the death and
      passion of Christ; and this my death is and shall be a witness of
      my faith unto you all here present. Good people! as many of you as
      believe as I believe, pray for me.’</p>

    <p>Then she came to the stake, and laid her hand on it, and said,
      ‘Welcome the cross of Christ.’ Which being done, she, looking on
      her hand, and seeing it blacked with the stake, wiped it upon her
      smock; for she was burnt at the same stake that Simon Miller and
      Elizabeth Cooper was burnt at. Then, after she had touched it with
      her hand, she came and kissed it, and said, ‘Welcome the sweet
      cross of Christ’; and so gave herself to be bound thereto. After
      the tormentors had kindled the fire to her, she said, ‘My soul doth
      magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoiceth in God my Saviour.’ And
      in so saying, she set her hands together right against her breast,
      casting her eyes and head upward; and so stood, heaving up her
      hands by little and little, till the very sinews of her arms did
      brast in sonder, and then they fell. But she yielded her life unto
      the Lord as quietly as if she had been in a slumber, or as one
      feeling no pain; so wonderfully did the Lord work with her: His
      name therefore be praised for evermore.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Remember that the example was not only an admonition to those who saw
    her death: it was related by the spectators; it was spread through the
    length and breadth of the land; it was written down by Foxe, in whose
    hands it certainly lost nothing of eloquence or of dramatic effect,
    and it has been read ever since by countless people. Not the martyrdom
    of Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> rest of the bishops, priests
    and scholars, so much as those of the “very simple” women, the plain
    craftsmen, built up the Protestant Faith, scattered the Spanish Fleets,
    and changed the Englishman of the sixteenth century, so that he of the
    seventeenth became possible.</p>

  <p>The bare list of burnings in London alone, not nearly complete, as
    enumerated by Henry Machyn in his <i>Diary</i> (1550–1563), conveys a sense
    of the overwhelming horror which filled England during this reign,
    perhaps clearer than a laboured treatise on the Lives and Deaths of
    the Martyrs. In reading the list we can see the crowds flocking to
    Smithfield: all their sympathies are with the sufferer; they see him
    dragged on his hurdle, undressed to the shirt and tied to the stake;
    they see that he flinches not nor offers to retract; the faggots are
    piled about him, Heaven grant they be of dry wood; from the flames and
    through the smoke they hear the voice of the martyr praising God and
    praying till the end comes, when his tongue swells up in his mouth and
    he can speak no more, or is suffocated with the smoke, or with the
    intensity of his agony his heart stops and merciful Death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> seizes him.
    Then the crowd go home again; they dare not speak to each other; but
    they remember.</p>

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> question as to the proportion of Protestants to Catholics at the
    accession of Elizabeth, and at her death, has received various answers,
    depending upon the religion of the respondent. Lingard, the fairest
    of all the Catholic writers, estimates the number of Catholics at
    one-half the whole population. This was thirty years before Elizabeth’s
    accession. Dr. Allen thought they were two-thirds (Strype, iii. 415).
    A great many of the better class were Catholics. Venner (1649) says
    that fifty years before, all physicians were Catholics. This may have
    been caused by study in Italian schools of medicine. A good many people
    in London attended mass at some Ambassador’s chapel. The Spaniards
    when the Armada was projected relied upon the opinion that the half
    of England would join them. The North of England was filled with
    Catholics, yet they did not join the Rebellion of 1569. One-fourth of
    the population of Cheshire were Catholics; on the other hand, there is
    testimony to the effect that the number of Catholics had enormously
    decreased in the first thirty years of Elizabeth’s reign. In 1569 there
    were in London twelve to fifteen places where mass was regularly said.
    In 1594 a Jesuit speaks of the “little sparkle of Catholic religion
    yet reserved amongst us” as soon to be extinguished. The common-sense
    view of the case seems to be this. The people of London who, as we have
    seen, were filled with Lollardry from the beginning of the fifteenth
    century; who welcomed the Dissolution of the Religious Houses; who
    rejoiced at such a shadow of free thought as Henry afforded them; who
    shuddered with horror at the flames of Smithfield;—were overjoyed at
    the return of the Protestant Faith. But it would be wrong to suppose
    that all the scholars, all who had lived among the better-class priests
    and friars, went over to the new Faith; they did not: a large number of
    gentlewomen remained steadfast; the Government showed its good sense
    by taking no notice, or as little as possible, of recusants. Burleigh
    advised against punishing these people by death; best not make martyrs;
    there was no true method of lessening their numbers “but by preaching
    and by education of the younger under good schoolmasters.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

  <p>In a word, if it is intended to make any form of faith decay, there is
    no need of persecution: it has only to be surrounded by disabilities.
    If a Roman Catholic could hold no municipal office, and no State
    office, could not enter a grammar school or the university, could not
    take a degree, could not become a lawyer, could not sit in either
    House, could not serve in the army or the navy, then the Roman Catholic
    religion would fall rapidly into decay. This is exactly what happened;
    at the present moment, though all disabilities have been removed, the
    proportion of Catholics in England and Scotland is certainly not more
    than one in twenty. The “old” Catholics were those wealthy families
    which could continue in spite of all disabilities, a few noble houses
    and a few county people. Similar results attended the disabilities of
    the Nonconformists. Dissent survived its disabilities among people who
    cared nothing for office, people at the lower end of society, people
    for the most part of small trade. Among the better class, Dissent lost
    ground and mostly disappeared till the abolition of disabilities.</p>

  <p>It is commonly believed that in the parish churches there was but one
    step from the mass to the Reformed service. This was not so (see an
    article by Mr. T. T. Micklethwaite on “Parish Churches in the year
    1548,” <i>Arch. Journ.</i> xxxv.). The Dissolution of the Religious Houses
    made at first very little difference in the churches. The guilds were
    suppressed, and therefore the lights which they kept up; the endowed
    lights were also suppressed; but people went on endowing new lights
    for the parish churches. In the year 1547 certain rules or injunctions
    were issued which commanded that all images which had been made the
    object of pilgrimage should be destroyed; that no lights should be set
    up before any picture except two wax tapers on the altar, and these
    because Christ is the Light of the World. Images which had not been
    abused were to remain “for remembrance only.” The English Bible and
    the Paraphrases of Erasmus on the Gospel were to be set up in every
    church where the people could have access to them. Shrines, pictures of
    miracles, and glass depicting miracles, were to be destroyed; a pulpit
    was to be provided, and an alms chest to be placed by the altar.</p>

  <p>As regards the services, changes were gradual. The High Mass continued,
    but the Gospel and Epistle were read in English, and a chapter from the
    New Testament was read after lessons at Matins and after Magnificat
    at Evensong. The English Litany was sung after High Mass. The Pater
    Noster, Creed, and Ten Commandments were sometimes publicly rehearsed
    in English, and Communion was refused to those who did not know them.</p>

  <p>In the year 1548 the “Order of Communion” was put forth; in 1549 the
    Prayer Book appeared. Mr. Micklethwaite has drawn up an account of
    the parish church of 1548 before the Reformed Prayer Book, and with
    the alterations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> made in the service up to that date. The principal
    entrance was by the south door; in the porch was a basin of holy water;
    the font stood sometimes in the middle of the nave, sometimes against
    the west side of one of the pillars; it had a cover which could be
    locked down. Near it was a locker in which were kept the oils, salt,
    etc., required for the old rite of baptism.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“At the beginning of the sixteenth century all but very poor parish
      churches seem to have been furnished with pews, but the whole area
      was not filled with them, as at a later date. Old pews west of the
      doors are very rare, but they are found sometimes, as at Brington,
      Northants. Generally all this space was left clear, and there
      was a clear area of at least one bay, and often much more at the
      west end. A church with aisles had nearly always four blocks of
      pews, and the passages were broad alleys, that in the middle being
      often more than a third of the width of the nave, and the side
      passages were not much less. The appropriation of special places
      to individuals seems to have been usual, and even that bugbear of
      modern ecclesiastical reformers, the lock-up pew or closet, was not
      unknown. These in parish churches were generally chantry chapels,
      arranged for private services at their own altars and for use as
      pews during the public services.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The pulpit had no fixed position: it was made movable; one of that
    period still remains at Westminster. It was ordered in 1547 that the
    priests and choir should kneel in the midst of the church and sing
    or say the Litany; the Litany desk came into use afterwards. The
    confessional had been continued in certain London churches: at St.
    Margaret Patens there was the “shrivyng pew”; at St. Christopher le
    Stock the “Shriving House.” The usual custom was for the penitent to
    kneel or stand before the priest, who sat in a chair. The Bible and the
    Paraphrases of Erasmus were chained to a desk somewhere in the nave.</p>

  <p>The Rood screen, which was a music gallery, carried a loft and the
    organ when there was one. The loft contained desks for singers; it was
    also provided with pricks for candles. The great cross rose above the
    loft. In the chancel stood the high altar; when there were no aisles
    two smaller altars stood one on either side. Above the altar was a
    reredos of carved work; at the ends of which hung curtains. There
    was generally a super altar. On the high altar stood the cross, with
    figures, reliquaries, and images to adorn it. Also they laid on the
    altar the Textus or Book of the Gospels, with the paxbrede or tablet
    for the kiss of peace. There were generally two lights on the altar.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It is convenient to mention here the other lights, which were kept
      in 1548, by the retention of the ceremonies with which they were
      connected. These were the two tapers carried by boys in processions
      at High Mass, and at other services when solemnly performed; the
      herse light, used at Matins or Tenebres on the last three days of
      Holy Week; the paschal candle, which stood in a tall candlestick,
      or hung in a bason on the north side of the high altar, and was
      lighted with much ceremony on Easter Eve, and burned at all the
      principal services throughout Paschal tide; the torches carried in
      the procession on Corpus Christi Day; the lantern carried before
      the Sacrament when it was taken to the sick; the large standing
      tapers which were placed round a corpse during the funeral service;
      and the candle used at baptism. Most of the lights, which a little
      earlier had been common round tombs, were endowed, and as such had
      been taken away, but the custom of survivors placing lights round
      the graves of their departed friends would probably be continued
      still for a few years.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>Chapels were the most usual places for tombs, but they are found in
    every part of the church. The various forms of them are too familiar
    to require description, but the use of colour gave them much more
    decorative importance in an interior than they have now. Many were
    painted, and others were covered with rich cloths. Flat gravestones
    had often carpets laid over them, and raised tombs had palls of
    cloth of gold or other costly stuff. The church of Dunstable still
    possesses such a pall: it is of crimson velvet, richly embroidered.
    Tapestries and cloths of various kinds were very much used, especially
    in chancels, as curtains and carpets, and as coverings for seats and
    desks and the like. Every church also had special hangings for Lent,
    when images and pictures were covered up generally with white or
    blue cloths, marked with crosses and the emblems of the Passion. The
    Lenten veil between the choir and the high altar seems also to have
    been retained in 1547, but in 1548 Cranmer and his party had partly
    succeeded in doing away with it. All parts of the church were more or
    less adorned with imagery and pictures on walls, in windows, or on
    furniture. None had been ordered to be taken away except such as had
    been superstitiously abused, or which were representations of “feigned
    miracles.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“When the priest took the Sacrament to the sick he was accompanied
      by clerks, who carried a cross, bell, and light. The Sacrament
      itself was enclosed in a pyx, and with it was taken a cup in which
      the priest dipped his fingers after giving the communion. The
      chrismatory was generally a little box of metal containing three
      little bottles for the three oils, which seem generally to have
      been kept together. For use at funerals, every church had a cross,
      a bier, and a handbell, the last being a good-sized bell which was
      rung before the corpse as it was being carried to the church. It
      was also used for ‘crying’ obits about the parish, and asking for
      prayers for the deceased. Some churches had what was called the
      common coffin, which was used to carry bodies to the church, the
      most general custom being to bury without coffin. And they had
      palls and torches for funerals, for the use of which a charge was
      made according to the quality of the pall and the ‘waste’ of the
      torches. At weddings it was the custom to hold a large square cloth
      of silk or other material, called the care cloth, over the heads
      of the bride and bridegroom whilst they received the benediction,
      and it was kept for that use amongst the church goods. At St.
      Margaret’s, Westminster, we find also a crown or circlet for
      brides, which appears to have been a thing of some value.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen from these quotations that the parish church contained
    in essentials the whole of the Catholic ritual except the parts which
    were ordered to be read in English. At the same time by reading, by
    hearing sermons, by the newly awakened spirit of examination and
    discussion, the people were preparing for more drastic changes. When
    they came there was no violent revolution, and though many remained
    faithful to the old creed, the bulk of the people in London were
    Protestant at heart. The weak point of the Reformation was that as yet
    no one was sure that it was stable and assured. Nor was there any such
    assurance till the defeat of the Spanish Armada and fifty years of the
    Maiden Queen had turned Protestantism into patriotism.</p>

  <p>It is apparent (see <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xlv.) that the ancient
    vestments were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> worn in some of the churches after the Reformation,
    until they fell to pieces. At the church of St. Christopher le Stock
    they were worn until the third year of Elizabeth, when being worn out,
    and no funds existing to replace them, the simple surplice was used.
    Twelve tables hung on the wall of the church: one containing the Ten
    Commandments; eleven containing prayers to the saints. The Reformers,
    therefore, did not introduce a new thing when they hung up the Table of
    the Commandments.</p>

  <p>It used to be a custom in many City churches to ring the bell at 5
    <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; not the “apprentice bell,” but a continuation and a
    survival of the ancient practice to call the people to the early
    service. Thus, at St. Margaret’s, Lothbury, in 1573, it was “resolved
    that after every workday we shall have morning prayer at five o’clock;
    also to have a lecture every Wednesday and Friday, beginning at five
    o’clock and ending at six o’clock, the bell to toll half an hour after
    five every afternoon.” The books show a good deal of whipping of men
    and women. They were chiefly wanderers, tramps, and their great offence
    was in carrying the plague about the country.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

  <p>The services of the church could be made Lutheran in their character
    or Puritanic. The great difference was in the manner of singing. The
    Puritans sang in a plain tune all together; the Protestants “tossed”
    the Psalms from one side to the other with music of the organ.
    Congregational singing was one of the most important changes introduced
    by the Reformation. In September 1559 the new morning prayer “after
    Geneva fashion” was introduced at St. Antholin’s, the bell ringing at 5
    <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

  <p>There were still some processions kept up. On St. Andrew’s Day a
    procession was conducted at St. Paul’s with one priest out of every
    parish in the City, and on the 25th of September the boys of St.
    Anthony’s school marched together from Mile End down Cornhill with
    streamers and flags, whifflers and drums.</p>

  <p>In the church of St. Christopher le Stock we find that certain old
    customs were preserved: the church was decorated at Christmas with
    holly and ivy; at Easter with “rosemary, bay, and strawings.”</p>

  <p>The parish system seems to have been well worked; the streets were kept
    clean; evildoers were not allowed to harbour within the limits; taxes
    were collected; the sick were watched and tended.</p>

  <p>The efforts of the more sober leaders were directed to change, it
    is true, but to gradual not revolutionary change. The restraint
    of the zealous, however, was in some churches very difficult;
    certain quarters of the City were far more Protestant than others:
    Blackfriars, for instance, became an early centre of Puritanism; at St.
    Martin’s-in-the-Fields, on the other hand, we find the church-wardens
    quietly obeying every new ordinance, but keeping the old things in
    boxes ready for a possible return to the old order. The Dissolution
    of the Houses brought with it certain unexpected accompaniments. The
    servants of the Commissioners took away the sacred vestments and
    used them either for their own common wear or for saddlecloths, thus
    inflicting wanton insults on the faithful and bringing into contempt,
    with the desecration of the vestments, the very doctrines of which
    they were symbolical. Again, there were the relics and the images
    which the people had so long adored; it is true that the Church would
    not acknowledge the adoration of an image, but that was the practice
    of the common people, as it is at this day in every Roman Catholic
    Church. Thus sacred objects came to be treated with the utmost scorn:
    reliquaries were emptied and the relics thrown away; images of the
    Virgin were deprived of their lovely vestments, and sent about the
    country, shapeless lumps of wood, or brought to London to be publicly
    burned. In some cases an ancient and venerable fraud was discovered
    and pitilessly exposed. Who could resist contempt for the priests and
    monks who had for many generations of simple believers made the head on
    the Holy Rood of Boxley incline benignantly and roll its eyes upon the
    kneeling multitude? With all these aids to disbelief who can wonder
    if the wave of Protestant indignation mounted steadily higher; if the
    fiery spirit of Reform seized upon town and country, upon the sober
    merchant and the hot-headed ’prentice? We hear of the young men reading
    the Bible aloud in the churches, shouting the words they read; of girls
    who carried the English Primer with them to church and studied it
    during the singing of Matins; of men who insulted the Consecration of
    the Host; who attacked the priest who carried it through the streets.
    It is certain that London itself, almost from the beginning, was for
    the Reformation. (<i>See</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_V">Appendix V.</a>)</p>

  <p>A pressing difficulty, in the opening years of Elizabeth, was the
    illiterate and immoral condition of the clergy. So many refused the
    oath of supremacy that it became necessary to create lay readers.
    Indeed, the condition of England, including London, was calculated to
    fill the minds of the most ardent Protestants with dismay. During the
    first fifteen years of the reign, the House of Commons complained to
    the Queen that men were ordained who were infamous in their lives and
    conversation; the Bishop of London complained that even the Bishops
    were “sunk and lamentably disvalued by the meanest of the peoples”; the
    County of Essex represented that the new clergy were ignorant, riotous
    and drunkards; the Lords in Council represented to the Archbishop of
    Canterbury the evil lives of the clergy. Out of all the clergy in the
    City of London there were but nineteen preachers. Yet in 1559 Elizabeth
    ordered that there should be a sermon once a month on doctrine. And in
    1586 the Bishop of London ordered the clergy to write one Sermon every
    week. It is said that the clergy fell so low in esteem as to be treated
    like outcasts, incurably drunken, ignorant, and licentious.</p>

  <p>With the general charges against the Elizabethan Clergy it appears
    unnecessary to bring forward specific acts which may very well be taken
    to be isolated cases, in no way proving general corruption. There are,
    however, a few which seem to show the general condition of things.</p>

  <p>In 1562, a priest was carted through the City for saying mass.</p>

  <p>In 1554 priests, who would not leave their wives, did penance in St.
    Paul’s, and were beaten over the head with rods.</p>

  <p>In 1561 the Queen, who never approved the marriage of priests, ordered
    those who were married not to bring their wives into Colleges.</p>

  <p>In the same year there were found to be many conjurors in Westminster
    including priests, one of whom was put in pillory.</p>

  <p>In 1557 the priest of St. Ethelburga was pilloried for sedition, and
    had his ears nailed to the pillory.</p>

  <p>In 1559 there was a great burning of copes, censers, crosses, altar
    cloths, rood cloths, books, banners, etc.</p>

  <p>In 1560 a priest was hanged for cutting a purse; it was his second
    offence.</p>

  <p>The priest who sold his wife to a butcher, and was carried through the
    streets for an open shame, must hardly, one hopes, be quoted as an
    example. We picture him as a drunken and dissolute hog, lost to all
    sense of decency. The other priest who for an act of immorality was
    also carried about the streets may have been more common. When all the
    clergy married as a matter of course such scandals ceased.</p>

  <p>As I have reproduced certain charges against the clergy and Religious
    of the old Faith, it is but fair to give an example of the bad
    character of one, at least, belonging to the clergy of the Reformation.
    The following letter is addressed to the Lady Bowes:—</p>

  <p>“Right Worshipfull,</p>

  <p>Harrison, however, speaks up for the credit of the Reformed Clergy.</p>

  <p>The observance of Lent was maintained by law, but with difficulty, and
    the law was continually broken. It was a distinguishing mark of the
    Puritan to eat flesh on the forbidden days. Queen Elizabeth ordered
    that no flesh should be eaten on “fish days,” namely, the forty days of
    Lent, Ember Days, Rogation Days, and Fridays. Licenses, however, were
    granted for those who either on account of bodily infirmity, or any
    other cause, were forbidden to fast. The license cost, for a nobleman
    or his wife, 26s. 8d. per annum; for a knight or his wife, 13s. 4d. per
    annum; and for those of lower degree, 6s. 8d. per annum.</p>

  <p>Thus began the evasion of the law. Butchers were licensed to kill for
    those privileged to eat flesh. In 1581 the House of Lords call upon the
    Mayor to explain why forty butchers are allowed to kill during Lent,
    and how it is that the eating of flesh at that season is common in the
    City. The Mayor replies that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> the facts are otherwise, and that the
    number of licensed butchers is only five, viz. two for either Shambles
    and one for Southwark.</p>

  <p>In 1552 only three butchers are licensed. Evidently the Mayor tries
    strong measures. But there are more complaints from the Lords.</p>

  <p>In 1586 the House of Lords again send representations to the Mayor.</p>

  <p>In 1587 the Mayor, evidently wishing to shift responsibility, says
    that it is difficult to restrain butchers. Perhaps the House of Lords
    will undertake the duty of licensing. The House of Lords declines to
    undertake the work of the Mayor.</p>

  <p>In 1590 the Mayor complains of butchers being licensed in privileged
    places. What does this mean?</p>

  <p>In 1591 he gives licenses to six butchers. He then finds out what we
    have been suspecting all along, that cattle and sheep were killed
    outside his jurisdiction, and that flesh was brought into the City by
    the gates. He also proves that within the City itself a great deal more
    meat is killed than was wanted for Shrovetide. Here we have a proof of
    the Puritanic spirit. The unlicensed butchers, on the eve of Lent, kill
    a great deal more than is wanted for Shrovetide; the licensed butchers
    go on killing. Do they sell to none but persons who have paid for the
    privilege? And every day carcases are brought in at the gates wrapped
    up in some kind of cloth for disguise.</p>

  <p>In 1615 the Mayor gives up the attempt. He says that all butchers kill
    and sell meat in Lent, on Fridays, and that the people buy it freely on
    Fridays and on the other forbidden days.</p>

  <p>Still there is maintained the pretence of an enforced fast during Lent
    until the Civil War, after which there are no more attempts to make
    the people fast, while many of the better class, clergy and others,
    continue to abstain from meat on the forbidden days.</p>

  <p>There are grave complaints, both before and after the Reformation,
    about the behaviour of the people in church. The complaints point to
    two widely different causes. The first cause, that which operated
    before the Reformation, was undoubtedly the formalism into which
    religion had fallen. To be present at Mass, merely to be present, to
    kneel at the right time, was the whole of religion. Sir Thomas More, a
    most devout Catholic, complains bitterly of the irreverence of people
    at church service. Outward behaviour, he says, “is a plain express
    mirror or image of the mind, inasmuch as by the eyes, by the cheeks,
    by the eyelids, by the brows, by the hands, by the feet, and finally
    by the gesture of the whole body, right well appeareth how madly and
    fondly the mind is set and disposed.” He applies this observation to
    himself and the congregation. Sometimes “we solemnly get to and fro,
    and other whiles fairly and softly set us down again.” “When we have to
    kneel we do it upon one knee, or we have one cushion to kneel upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> and
    another to support the elbows. We never pretend to listen: we pare our
    nails; we claw our head.”</p>

    <div class="caption">A ROYAL PICNIC<br />
      From Turberville’s <i>Book of Hunting</i>, 1575.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The second cause was the rise of the new Religion. It was inevitable
    that with the destruction of the old forms a period of irreverence
    should set in. The churches quickly began to show signs of neglect.
    The windows were broken, the doors were unhinged, the walls fell into
    decay, the very roofs were in some places stripped of their lead.
    “The Book of God,” says Stubbes, “was rent ragged, and all be-torn.”
    Some of the churches were used for stabling horses. Armed men met in
    the churchyard, and wrangled, or shot pigeons with hand-guns over the
    graves. Pedlars sold their wares in the church porches during service.
    Morrice-dancers excited inattention and wantonness by their presence
    in costume, so as to be ready for the frolics which generally followed
    prayers. “Many there are,” said Sandys, preaching before Elizabeth even
    after her reforms, “that hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> not a sermon in seven years, I might say
    in seventeen.” The friends of the new doctrine expected that all the
    evils of the time would be instantly remedied. But the work of reform
    was extremely gradual.</p>

  <p>A third reason is offered for the irreverence of the people during
    service, this time during the Anglican service. Many people walked
    about, talked and laughed. This, however, was to show their contempt
    for the new order; they were secretly attached to the ancient Faith;
    they betrayed their sympathies, not only by this intolerance, but also
    by crossing themselves and telling their beads in secret.</p>

  <p>Many of the ancient customs remained. It was long before the people,
    in London, could be persuaded to give up their old customs. Sunday
    remained the weekly holiday: the people held on Sundays their wakes,
    ales, rush-bearings, May games, bear-baitings, dancing, piping,
    picnics, and gaming; they continued so to “break the Sabbath”—which
    was first made part of the Christian week by the Puritans—until well
    into the seventeenth century. After the Commonwealth I think that there
    were very few traces of old customs lingering in the country, and only
    those, such as the hanging of garlands in the chancel when a maiden
    died, which carried with them no doctrinal significance and could prove
    no occasion for drunkenness and debauchery.</p>

  <p>Before the coming of the Puritans the funerals continued with much
    of the old ritual. The body was laid out in such state as the family
    circumstances allowed: tapers were burned round it by night and by day;
    the church bells still rang for the prayers of the people, though they
    were taught that to pray for the dead was a vain thing; the priests who
    visited the house of the dead repeated the Lord’s Prayer; if on the
    way to the churchyard the procession passed a cross, they stopped and
    knelt, and made prayers; the body was laid in the grave wrapped in a
    shroud, without a coffin; it was covered by a pall, which was decorated
    with crosses. Those of the ancient Faith would persuade the clergymen,
    if they could, to omit the service; if he persisted, they left the
    grave and walked away. Nothing was a stronger tie to the old Religion
    than its burial service, and its assurance that the dead who died in
    the Church were assured of Heaven after due purgatory, and that the
    prayers of the living were of avail to shorten the pains of prison.</p>

  <p>Machyn, the City Chronicler of this period, thus describes the
    simplicity of a Protestant funeral:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The iij day of Aprell was browth unto saint Thomas of Acurs in
      Chepe from lytyll sant Barthellmuw in Lothberes masteres ... and
      ther was a gret compene of pepull, ij and ij together, and nodur
      prest nor clarke, the nuw prychers in ther gowne lyke leymen,
      nodur syngyng nor sayhyng tyll they came to the grave, and a-for
      she was pute into the grayff a collect in Englys, and then put
      into the grayff, and after took some heythe, and caste yt on the
      corse and red a thynge ... for the sam, and contenent cast the
      heth into the grave, and contenent red the pystyll of sant Poll to
      the Stesselonyans the chapter, and after thay song pater noster in
      Englys, boyth prychers and odur and women of a nuw fassyon, and
      after on of them whent into the pulpytt and made a sermon.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

  <p>The following note by Machyn presents one of the last appearances of
    the old Sanctuary customs:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The vi day of December the abbot of Westminster went a procession
      with his convent; before him went all the sanctuary men with crosse
      keys upon their garments, and after whent iij for murder: one was
      the Lord Dacre’s sone of the Northe was wypyd with a shett abowt
      him for Kyllyng of on master West, sqwyre, dwellyng besyd ...; and
      anodur theyff that dyd long to one of master comtroller ... dyd
      kylle Recherd Eggyllston the comtroller’s tayller, and killed him
      in the Lord Acurs, the bak-syd Charyng-crosse; and a boy that kyld
      a byge boye that sold papers and pryntyd bokes, with horlyng of a
      stone and yt hym under the ere in Westmynster Hall; the boy was one
      of the chylderyn that was at the sckoll ther in the abbey; the boy
      was a hossear [hosier] sune a-boyff London-stone.” (<i>Diary of Henry
        Machyn</i>, p. 121.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The good old institution of Sanctuary died hard. Even after it was
    supposed to have been finished and put away it continued to linger.
    Abbot Feckenham made a vigorous appeal for its preservation. “All
    princes,” he said, “and all Lawmakers, Solon in Athens, Lycurgus
    in Lacedemon, all have had <i>loca refugii</i>, places of succour and
    safe-guard for such as have transgressed laws and deserved corporal
    pains. Since, therefore, ye mean not to destroy all sanctuaries, and if
    your purpose be to maintain any, or if any be worthy to be continued,
    Westminster, of all others, is most worthy, and that for four causes:
    the first is, the antiquity and continuance of sanctuary there;
    the second, the dignity of the person by whom it was ordained; the
    third, the worthiness of the place itself; the fourth, the profit and
    commodity that you have received thereby.”</p>

  <p>It is a common charge against the Dissolution of the Religious Houses
    that the old custom of open tables for all comers fell into disuse.
    The disuse is not without exceptions. The Houses being suppressed, of
    course the hospitality disappeared; but the practice was still kept up
    by some of the Bishops: Archbishop Parker, for instance, fed every day
    a number of poor people who waited outside the gates of Lambeth for the
    broken meats; while any one who chose to come in, whether at dinner or
    at supper, was received and entertained either at the Steward’s or the
    Almoner’s table. Order was observed; no loud talking was permitted; and
    the discourse was directed towards framing men’s manners to Religion.
    Whether the practice of indiscriminate doles should have been kept up
    is another question, and one that cannot be asked of the sixteenth
    century. The state and dignity maintained by this Archbishop were
    almost worthy of Cardinal Wolsey: the Queen gave him a patent for forty
    retainers, but his household consisted of five times that number, all
    living with him and dining at his table in Lambeth Palace.</p>

  <p>The Church House was an ecclesiastical edifice which has now entirely
    passed away. I know nothing about the Church House except what is found
    in the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, vol. xl. p. 8.</p>

  <p>“Not a single undoubted specimen has been spared to us, though it is
    not improbable that the half-timbered building attached to the west end
    of the church at Langdon, in Essex, and now called the Priest House, is
    really one of these.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> We have evidence from all parts of the country
    that they were once very common. There is, indeed, hardly an old
    churchwarden’s account-book which goes back beyond the changes of the
    sixteenth century that does not contain some reference to a building of
    this kind. They continued in being and to be used for church purposes
    long after the Reformation. The example at All Saints, Derby, stood in
    the churchyard and was in existence in 1747.”... “We must picture to
    ourselves then a long, low room with an ample fireplace, or rather a
    big open chimney occupying one end with a cast hearth. Here the cooking
    was done, and here the water boiled for brewing the church ale. There
    was a large oak table in the middle with benches around, and a lean-to
    building on one side to act as a cellar. This, I think, is not an
    inaccurate sketch of a building which played no unimportant part in our
    rural economy and rural pleasures. All the details are wanting, and
    we can only fill them in by drawing on the imagination. We know that
    almost all our churches were made beautiful by religious painting on
    the walls. I should not be surprised if we some day discovered that
    the church-house came in for its share of art, and that pictures, not
    religious in the narrow sense, but grotesque and humorous, sometimes
    covered the walls. It was in the church-house that the ales were held.
    They were provided for in various ways, but usually by the farmers,
    each of whom was wont to give his quota of malt. There was no malt
    tax in those days, and as a consequence there was a malt-kiln in
    almost every village. These ales were held at various times. There
    was almost always one on the Feast of the Dedication of the Church.
    Whitsuntide was also a very favourite time; but they seem to have been
    held at any convenient time when money was wanted for the church....
    Philip Stubbes, the author of the <i>Anatomie of Abuses</i>, only knew the
    Church Ales in their decline. He was, Anthony Wood informs us, a most
    rigid Calvinist, a bitter enemy to Popery, so that his picture must
    be received with allowances for exaggeration. His account of them is
    certainly not a flattering one. He tells us that ‘The Churche Wardens
    ... of every parishe, with the consent of the whole parishe, provide
    halfe a score or twentie quarters of mault, wherof some they buye
    of the churche stocke, and some is given them of the parishioners
    themselves, everyone conferryng some-what, accordyng to his abilitie;
    which mault beeyng made into very strong ale or beere is sette to sale,
    either in the churche or some other place assigned to that purpose.
    Then, when this ... is sette abroche, well is he that can gette soonest
    to it and spend the most at it; for he that sitteth the closest to it
    and spendes the moste at it, he is counted the godliest man of all the
    rest, and moste in God’s favour, because it is spent uppon His church
    forsoth. But who, either for want can not, or otherwise for feare of
    God’s wrath will not sticke to it, he is counted none destitute both
    of vertue and godlines.... In this kind of practise they continue six
    weekes, a quarter of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> yere, yea helfe a yeare together, swillyng
    and gullyng, night and daie, till they be as dronke as rattes, and as
    blockishe as beastes.... That money ... if all be true which they saie
    ... they repair their churches and chappels with it, they buie bookes
    for service, cuppes for the celebration of the sacrements, surplesses
    for Sir John, and such other necessaries.’”</p>

  </div>

  <p>The burning of St. Paul’s steeple created a great sensation, and was
    by some regarded as an act of God’s wrath for the recent changes.
    Maitland<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> quotes an original letter describing the disaster:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1561, on Wednesday the 4th of June, as appears
      by a Letter before me from Mr. Richard Jones to Sir Nicholas
      Throckmorton, Ambassador from Queen Elizabeth to the Court of
      France, communicated by the honourable Mr. Yorke, it rained all
      the Day, and, towards Four of the Clock in the Afternoon, it
      began to thunder terribly: ‘When suddenly a Thunder-bolt, with a
      great Thunder following, hit within a Yard of the very top of the
      Steeple, which forthwith shewed his Effect, and appeared a little
      Fire, like unto the Light of a Torch, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> increasing towards
      the Weather-cock, caused the same within a quarter of an hour to
      fall down; whereby the Wind, which was great, and the more vehement
      by reason of the opening of the Steeple and Height thereof, caused
      the Flame so to augment, and burn the Steeple, which no Man could
      succour, as within an Hour the high Steeple of Paul’s, which was
      so long in building, and so renowned, was utterly consumed to the
      very Battlements; which being of some Breadth and Strength, as was
      needful to uphold such a weight, received most part of the Timber
      which fell from the Spire, and began to burn with such Vehemence,
      as all the Timber was burnt, the Iron and Bells melted and fallen
      down upon the stairs within a short space. This was judged to be
      the end of the effect of the lightning; when forthwith the East
      and West roofs of the Church, partly kindled with the timber which
      fell from the Battlements, and with the heating of the Fire whiles
      it remained within the Stone Steeple, were on Fire, and ceased not
      to burn so extremely, as could not be provided for by no means,
      till that not only those ends, but the north and south ails, before
      one of the Clock after Midnight, were consumed, and not a piece of
      Timber left, nor Lead unmolten, upon any of the higher and cross
      Roofs and Battlements. The side Ails, tho’ they were a little
      touched, by reason of their Crowns, remained safe, Thanks be to
      God. And this is all that is happened by this Misfortune, and the
      Church within is untouched. Your Lordship may guess what Stir and
      Removing there was in St. Paul’s Church-yard, especially towards
      the North door, where divers Houses were pulled down, and much
      lamentation on all sides. On the East End a Pinnacle fell down and
      ruined a House, wherein there were seven Persons not hurt, but the
      good man of the House a little. Many other turmoils there were, as
      in like Cases it happens; which, as it grieves me to hear, so I
      am loth to write the same. The French here are not sorry for the
      Matter. All good and honest Men are sorry for it, and impute it to
      a terrible remembrance of God’s Anger towards us for our Offences.
      This is enough and too much of so grievous a matter; and yet I
      thought I should perhaps satisfy your Lordship in writing thereof
      thus largely.</p>

  <p>As might have been expected of a time when all the world was thinking
    and talking about religious doctrine, the unlearned as well as the
    learned, but with much more confidence and presumption, arguing
    entirely on the meaning of texts, passages, and detached clauses, there
    were fanatics in plenty. I have made a selection from the cases before
    me.</p>

  <p>“William Hacket gave out that he was Jesus Christ, come to judge the
    World; which was soon proclaimed throughout the City of London by
    Edmond Coppinger and Henry Arthington, two of his Disciples; who, going
    from Hacket’s Lodgings, at Broken-Wharf, thro’ Watling-Street and the
    Old-Change, amidst an excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> Multitude, to Cheapside, they mounted
    an empty cart near the end of Gutter Lane, and proclaimed Mercy from
    Heaven to all such as should repent and believe that Christ (William
    Hacket) was come with his Fan in his hand to judge the Earth, and to
    establish the Gospel in Europe, and that he was then to be seen, with
    his glorious Body, at one Walker’s, at Broken-Wharf; and that they
    were Prophets, the one of Mercy, and the other of Judgment, sent by
    God Himself as Witnesses, and to assist in the present great Work.
    The first of whom incessantly proclaimed Mercy and Joys inexpressible
    to all such as should receive this acceptable Message; and the last
    denounced terrible Judgments against the Obdurate, which should
    not only immediately fall upon the Incredulous in this City, but
    that likewise all such were condemned to eternal Punishments; and,
    in a particular and very treasonable Manner, thundered out bitter
    invectives against the Queen and her Ministry; wherefore they were all
    apprehended, and Hacket, the pretended Messiah, soon after tried and
    convicted at the Old-Baily of Treason; whence he was carried to the
    Place of Execution in Cheapside, where, instead of shewing the least
    Sorrow for his Crimes, he committed the most horrid and execrable
    Blasphemies against God, and detestable imprecations against the Queen
    and her Ministers; and his associate, Coppinger, refusing all Manner
    of sustenance, died the next Day in Bridewell, as did Arthington, his
    Companion, some Time after in Wood Street Compter.” Evidently three
    enthusiasts all equally mad and equally obstinate.</p>

  <p>Later on, also, was the case of Anne Burnell (Sharpe, i. 552):—</p>

  <p>“The strain which the continuation of the war and the threatened
    renewal of a Spanish invasion imposed upon the inhabitants of London
    at large was a great one, and appears to have affected the mind of a
    weak and hysterical woman, Anne Burnell. She gave out that she was a
    daughter of the King of Spain, and that the arms of England and Spain
    were to be seen, like stigmata, upon her back, as was vouched for by
    her servant, Alice Digges. After medical examination, which proved her
    statement to be ‘false and proceedinge of some lewde and imposterouse
    pretence,’ she and her maid were ordered to be whipt,—‘ther backes
    only beeinge layd bare,’—at the cart’s tail through the City on a
    market day, ‘with a note in writinge uppon the hinder part of their
    heades shewinge the cawse of their saide punishmente.’”</p>

  <p>Again, there was the case of William Geffery and John Moore. These two
    unfortunate creatures were perfectly mad, and ought to have been locked
    up in Bethlehem. Said William Geffery to the other lunatic, “Christ
    is not in Heaven, John. He is on earth and like unto us.” “He is,”
    John replied, “and thou thyself, William Geffery, art none other than
    Christ.” “That,” said William, “is perfectly correct.” They therefore
    clapped John Moore in Bethlehem and William Geffery in the Marshalsea.
    This should have been enough. But it was not the fashion of the time
    ever to have enough of punishing. They therefore <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>tied Geffery to the
    cart tail and flogged him all the way from the Marshalsea to Bethlehem,
    a matter of two miles. At the gate of Bethlehem the cart was stopped.
    Then John Moore was brought out, and Geffery was flogged again until he
    confessed his error and acknowledged that Christ was in Heaven and that
    he himself was nothing but a sinful man. They then stripped John Moore
    and tied him to the cart tail; at first he took the punishment smiling,
    but before going an arrow’s shot he begged them to stop, and confessed
    that he was wrong. So they both went back: John Moore to Bethlehem and
    William Geffery to the Marshalsea, and we hear no more of them.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptists were another perverse people who met with no mercy. On
    3rd April 1575 there was found a congregation of Anabaptists in a house
    outside Aldgate Bars. Twenty-seven in all were arrested. On the 15th
    of May four of them, bearing faggots to show that they deserved death,
    recanted at Paul’s Cross; on 22nd July two of them were burned at
    Smithfield, “who died in great horror, with roaring and crying.” Their
    recantation shows the doctrines they held.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Whereas I.I.T.R.H. being seduced by the devil, the spirit of
      error, and by false teachers his ministers, have fallen into
      certain most detestable and damnable heresies, namelie:—</p>

    <p>1. That Christ tooke not flesh of the substance of the blessed
      Virgin Marie.</p>

    <p>2. That infants of the faithful ought not be baptized.</p>

    <p>3. That a Christian man may not be a magistrate, or beare the sword
      or office of authoritie.</p>

    <p>4. That it is not lawful for a Christian to take an oth. Now by
      the Grace of God, and through conference with good and learned
      ministers of Christ His church, I doo understand and acknowledge
      the same to be most damnable and detestable heresies, and doo aske
      God here before His church mercie for my said former errors, and
      doo forsake them, recant and renounce them, and abjure them from
      the botome of my heart, professing that I certainly believe:</p>

    <p>1. That Christ tooke flesh of the substance of the blessed Virgin
      Marie.</p>

    <p>2. That infants of the faithfull ought to be baptized.</p>

    <p>3. That a Christian man may be a magistrate, or beare the sword or
      office of authoritie.</p>

    <p>4. That it is lawful for a Christian man to take an oth. And
      further that I confess that the whole doctrine and religion
      established and published in this realme of England, as also that
      which is received and preached in the Dutch Church, from henceforth
      utterlie abandoning and forsaking all and every anabaptistical
      error. This is my faith now, in the which I doo purpose and trust
      to stand firme and stedfast to the end. And that I may soo doo, I
      beseech you all to praie with me, and for me, to God the heavenlie
      father, in the name of his son our Saviour Jesus Christ.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Before this, one man and ten women were tried in the Consistory of St.
    Paul’s and sentenced to be burned, but one woman having been converted,
    they resolved on banishing the rest, who were Dutch. Accordingly the
    nine women were led by the sheriff, and the man was tied to a cart tail
    and whipped all the way from Newgate to the river, where they were
    shipped. And there was a certain sect called the Family of Love, which
    gave some trouble through their obstinacy. In the year 1575 five of
    them recanted; in 1580 the sect were thought of sufficient importance
    to justify a proclamation against them. The tenets of the people do
    not appear, but they were accused of holding it laudable to deny their
    connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> with their own sect, which made it impossible to convict
    them by their own confession.</p>

  <p>The case of Matthew Hamont, plough-wright, may conclude these cases
    of strange hallucinations and the conclusions of a disordered brain.
    He was a common man of no education, who took to thinking and reading
    about doctrines which he could not understand. He finally arrived at
    the conclusion that the New Testament, with the Gospels, is but an
    invention of man, that Christ was a mere man, and so on, shrinking
    from nothing. This poor lunatic they gravely tried, and because he had
    spoken words against the Queen, they first cut off both his ears, and
    then, after giving him a week of pain from his wounds, they burned him
    for a heretic.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> Religion stalks her caricature, Superstition. Now the credulities
    of London in the Elizabethan age were many and wonderful.</p>

  <p>Everybody, for instance, at that time believed in <i>witchcraft</i>. Yet
    there was not wanting an occasional protest.</p>

  <p>“I saie, that there is none which acknowledgeth God to be onlie
    omnipotent ... but will denie that the elements are obedient to
    witches, and at their commendement; or that they may at their pleasure
    send raine, haile, tempests, thunder, lightning.... Such faithlesse
    people are also persuaded that neither hale nor snowe, thunder nor
    lightening, raine nor tempestuous winds, come from the heavens at the
    commandement of God, but are raised by the cunning and power of witches
    and conjurers; inasmuch as a clap of thunder or a gale of wind is no
    sooner heard, but wither they run to ring bells, or crie out to burne
    witches, or else burne consecrated things, hoping by the smoke thereof
    to drive the devill out of the aire.”</p>

  <p>Witchcraft and magic were, however, recognised by the Government as
    real things. It was thought desirable in 1542 to pass an Act against
    these practices.</p>

  <p>“It shall be felony to practise, or cause to be practised conjurations,
    with craft, enchantment or sorcery, to get money: or to consume any
    person in his body, members, or goods; or to provoke any person to
    unlawful love; or for the despight of Christ or lucre of money to pull
    down any cross; or to declare where goods stolen,” etc.</p>

  <p>This Act of Henry VIII. was repeated or confirmed by Elizabeth twenty
    years later, and by James I. in 1603. Cranmer, in 1549, ordered the
    clergy to inquire “whether you know of any that use charms, sorcery,
    enchantment, witchcrafts, soothsaying, or any like craft invented by
    the devil.” And in 1558 Bishop Jewel, preaching before the Queen, said,
    “It may please your Grace to understand that witches and sorcerers
    within these last few years are marvellously increased within your
    Grace’s realm. Your subjects pine away even to the death; their colour
    fadeth; their flesh rotteth; their speech is benumbed; their senses are
    bereft.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p>The precautions used against witchcraft do not belong to London, where
    the belief in the superstition took a less active form than in the
    country. A pebble with a natural hole in it, a horseshoe picked up by
    accident and nailed up over the door, a hare’s foot in the pocket, a
    bit of witchwood, were simple precautions against the witch. I do not
    think that these superstitions were much followed in London, though
    there are examples that the terror of the witch prevailed in the City
    as well as in the country.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that the spread of education and the toleration of
    fine thoughts in religion did not destroy this horrible superstition.
    On the contrary it increased, and the seventeenth century, when the
    greatest amount of religious freedom was practised if not allowed, only
    made the belief in witchcraft more profound.</p>

  <p>Who could choose but to believe when Ben Jonson himself could write of
    witches as follows?</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Within a gloomy dimble she doth dwell,</div>
        <div class="i1">Down in a pit o’ergrown with brakes and briars,</div>

        <div class="i1">Torn with an earthquake down into the ground,</div>
        <div class="i1">’Mongst graves and grots, near an old charnel-house</div>

        <div class="i1">As fearful and melancholie as that</div>
        <div class="i1">She is about: with caterpillars’ kells,</div>
        <div class="i1">And knotty cobwebs, rounded in with spells.</div>
        <div class="i1">Thence she steals forth to relief in the fogs,</div>
        <div class="i1">And rotten mists, upon the fens and bogs,</div>
        <div class="i1">Down to the drowned lands of Lincolnshire:</div>
        <div class="i1">To make ewes cast their lambs, swine eat their farrow,</div>

        <div class="i1">Planted about her in the wicked feat</div>
        <div class="i1">Of all her mischiefs, which are manifold.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We may illustrate this belief by the case of Joan Cason or Freeman (she
    was the wife of one Freeman). She was indicted and solemnly tried by a
    jury on the charge of being a witch, and of having killed by witchcraft
    one Jane Cooke, aged three years.</p>

  <p>The principal evidence was Sarah Cooke, mother of the child. She kept
    an alehouse. She was one day drawing a pot of ale for a stranger when
    he remarked the languishing condition of her child, and suggested
    that it was bewitched. “Take,” he said, “a tile from the house of the
    suspected person, lay it in the fire, and if she really is a witch
    the tile will sparkle round the cradle.” Wonderful to relate, Sarah
    Cooke took a tile from the woman’s house, laid it in the fire, and
    it did “sparkle round the house.” At that moment Joan Cason herself
    looked in, gazed upon the child, and went away. Four hours after the
    child died. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> more was wanted? There was evidence corroborative.
    In the lifetime of the man Freeman there was something like a rat seen
    about her house, something that squeaked. In the end Joan was hanged,
    protesting her innocence, but confessing ill conduct with one Mason,
    who had died of the plague.</p>

  <p>There is also the case of Simon Penbrooke, living in St. George’s
    Parish, Southwark. He was suspected to be a conjurer, and was summoned
    before a court holden in the church of St. Mary Overies either for that
    or for some other case. As he was talking to a proctor, presumably
    about his defence, he suddenly fell dead, just as the Judge entered the
    church. Of course the Judge remarked that it was the just judgment of
    God towards those that used sorcery, “and a great example to admonish
    others to fear the justice of God.” They found upon him certain
    “develish” books of conjuration, with a tin man and other fearful
    things. And they were reminded of Leviticus xx. 6, “If anie soule turne
    himselfe after such as woorke with spirits and after soothsaiers, saith
    the Lorde, I will put my face against that soule, and will cut him off
    from among my people.”</p>

  <p>Another form of witchcraft was that of the professional conjurer. There
    was, for instance, the case of William Randoll, who was charged with
    conjuring to know where treasure was hid in the earth. Four others were
    charged with assisting at the conjuration. One has no doubt of the
    fact or of the means employed. Randoll used, of course, the well-known
    bent stick, the “verge de Jacob,” which is still employed all over the
    world for the discovery of water, though its properties and powers in
    revealing the existence of metals have been of late neglected, and are
    now nearly forgotten. The whole of the accused were condemned to death,
    but in the end Randoll alone was executed. There was said at the time
    to be five hundred professed conjurers in the country.</p>

  <p>The origin of touching for the King’s Evil is recounted by Stow in his
    <i>Annals</i> in the following manner:—</p>

  <p>“A young woman was afflicted with this disorder in a very alarming
    manner, and to a most disgusting degree, feeling uneasiness and pain
    consequent upon it in her sleep, dreamt that she should be cured by
    the simple operation of having the part washed by the King’s hand.
    Application was consequently made to Edward, by her friends, who very
    humanely consented to perform the unpleasant request. A bason of water
    was brought, with which he carefully softened the tumours till they
    broke, and the contents discharged; the sign of the cross wound up the
    charm; and the female retired, with the assurance of his protection
    during the remainder of the cure, which was effected within a week.”</p>

  <p>Of talismans and amulets the sixteenth century had many. The word
    talisman is an Arabic corruption of the Greek, <i>i.e.</i> the influence
    of a planet or Zodiacal sign upon a person born under it. It was a
    symbolical figure drawn or engraved. It was supposed at once to procure
    love and to avert danger. The amulet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> derived from Latin <i>amolior</i>,
    to do away with, or baffle, averted danger of all kinds. Amber kept
    children from danger; a child’s caul made lawyers prosper; the Evil Eye
    was averted by certain well-known symbols, including the locust; the
    closed hand, the pine cone, and other objects were amulets. The German
    Jew at the point of death tied his head round with knotted leather.
    The Turks cured apoplexy by encircling the head with a parchment strip
    painted with signs of the Zodiac. Spells were of all kinds.</p>

  <p>Among the superstitions of the time must not be forgotten that
    favourite form of superstition known as astrology, which still
    flourishes, though it is not so commonly practised and believed as
    formerly. Many of the Fathers of the Church denounced astrology, yet
    astrologers continued. After the Reformation they became more open
    in their profession and more daring in their pretensions. The names
    of Nostradamus, Cornelius Agrippa, William Lilly, Robert Fludd, John
    Dee, and Simon Former, occur as leaders among the astrologers, some of
    whom were also alchemists. Some of the English professors of astrology
    were pupils of Cornelius Agrippa in London and at Pavia; others went
    to study the science at Strasburg. Judicial astrology was in great
    vogue in London for two hundred years after the Reformation; hundreds
    of people gained their livelihood by casting nativities for children
    in which their future was foretold. The story of Dryden and his son’s
    nativity is well known. The astrologers picked out lucky days for the
    commencement of any kind of business; they told fortunes; they resolved
    questions; they recovered stolen goods; they predicted future events.
    It is, however, apparent from their own writings that they had little
    confidence in the stars, and that the popular part of astrology,
    at least, was for the most part guesswork, not without fraud. The
    astrologers of London in the sixteenth century formed themselves into a
    Society. In the year 1550 a certain Dr. Gell preached a sermon before
    the Society of Astrologers. Ashmole also mentions his own attendance
    at certain astrological banquets. But about the Society itself very
    little is known. Newton pointed out that the sun and stars were only
    other earths which could have no power over the destiny of men. But the
    superstition decayed very slowly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dee’s <i>Diary</i> is a <i>locus classicus</i> for the superstitions of his
    time—the last quarter of the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>He hears knockings in his chamber, with a voice like the shrieking of
    an owl, but more drawn out and more soft. He is offered a sight in a
    crystal and he “saw”—what did he see? He does not tell us.</p>

  <p>A friend is strangely troubled by a “spiritual creature” about
    midnight. Robert Gardiner reveals to him a great philosophical secret,
    which is received with common prayer. He hears of an alchemist who
    gives away “great lumps” of the philosopher’s stone. He dreams that he
    is to be bereft of his books.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

  <p>There was trouble with Anne his nurse. She was tempted by a wicked
    spirit who possessed her. He prayed with her; he anointed her with
    “holy oil” twice, the wicked spirit resisting. Despite the power of
    the oil Anne threw herself into the well, but was dragged out in time.
    Three weeks later she evaded her keeper and cut her throat.</p>

  <p>In 1596 Dee received a message from the Queen; he was to do what he
    would in philosophy and alchemy; no one should hinder him. And so on to
    the end of the <i>Diary</i>.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1899 there was found in the garden of Lincoln’s
    Inn a thin leaden tablet about four inches square. On one side were
    eighty-one small squares, arranged in a large square, each with a
    number engraved upon it. On the other side were three names—Hasmodar,
    Scherchemosh, and Scharhahan, with a symbol to each. The explanation
    is as follows:—The square is a charm; the number eighty-one is the
    number of the Moon, each planet having its own number in the “science”
    of astrology. The arrangement of the numbers in the eighty-one squares
    is such that added up vertically or horizontally or diagonally the sum
    shall always be the same. In this case it is 369. Why 369 I cannot
    explain. On the other side the three names are the three spirits of the
    Moon, each with its hieroglyph.</p>

  <p>The writing is an expression of an invitation or a command to the
    spirits to work mischief on an unfortunate man. Had the sorcerer
    desired good fortune he would have used a silver plate. In either case
    it was necessary to bury the plate in some secret place, unseen and
    unsuspected.</p>

  <p>The following story is gravely told by Philip Stubbes. Perhaps he did
    not believe it himself; but it is certain that he meant his readers to
    believe it.</p>

  <p>“This gentlewoman beeyng a very riche Merchaunte mannes daughter: upon
    a tyme was invited to a Bridall or Wedding, whiche was solemnized in
    that Toune, againste whiche daie she made great preparation, for the
    plumyng of herself in gorgious arraie, that as her body was moste
    beautifull, faire, and proper, so her attire in every respecte might
    bee corespondent to the same. For the accomplishment whereof, she
    curled her haire, she died her lockes, and laied them out after the
    best maner, she coloured her face with waters and Ointmentes; but in no
    case could she gette any (so curious and daintie she was) that could
    starche and sette her Ruffes and Neckerchers to her mynde; wherefore
    she sent for a couple of Laundresses, who did the best thei could to
    please her humours, but in anywise thei could not. Then fell she to
    sweare and teare, to cursse and banne, castyng the Ruffes under feete,
    and wishyng that the Devill might take her when she weare any of those
    Neckerchers againe. In the meane tyme (through the sufferaunce of God)
    the Devill, transformyng himself into the forme of a young man, as
    brave and proper as she in every pointe in outward appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> came
    in, fainyng himself to bee a woer or suter unto her. And seyng her thus
    agonized, and in suche a peltyng chase, he demaunded of her the cause
    thereof, who straight waie tolde hym how she was abused in the settyng
    of her Ruffes, which thyng beeyng heard of hym, he promised to please
    her minde, and thereto tooke in hande the setting of her Ruffes, whiche
    he performed to her greate contentation, and likyng, in so muche as
    she lokyng her self in a glasse (as the Devill bad her) became greatly
    inamoured with hym. This dooen, the yong man kissed her, in the doyng
    whereof he writhe her necke in sunder, so she died miserably, her
    bodie beyng metamorphosed into blacke and blewe colours most ugglesome
    to behold, and her face (whiche before was so amorous) became moste
    deformed, and fearfull to looke upon. This being knowen, preparaunce
    was made for her burial, a riche coffin was provided, and her fearfull
    bodie was laied therein, and it covered verie sumpteously. Foure men
    immediatly assaied to lifte up the corps, but could not move it, then
    sixe attempted the like, but could not once stirre it from the place
    where it stoode. Whereat the standers by marveilyng, caused the Coffin
    to bee opened, to see the cause thereof. Where thei founde the bodie
    to be taken awaie, and a blacke Catte verie leane and deformed sittyng
    in the Coffin, setting of greate Ruffes, and frizlyng of haire, to the
    greate feare and wonder of all beholders. This wofull spectacle have I
    offered to their viewe, that by looking into it, instead of their other
    looking Glasses thei might see their own filthinesse, and avoyde the
    like offence, for feare of the same, or worser judgment: whiche God
    graunt thei maie doe.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Let</span> us climb the steps that lead to the City Wall at the Tower postern,
    and make a circuit by means of the Wall. We walk on the five-foot
    way designed for the archers. It is grass-grown between the stones.
    On the battlements the wall-flower grows luxuriously with the green
    fumitory and the red flowers of the kiss-me-quick. Looking over the
    Wall we perceive that the ditch is nearly filled up: all kinds of
    rubbish have been shot into it; there are small ponds of water here
    and there, and on the opposite bank are gardens in patches and what
    we call allotments. “Alas!” says our guide, who continually laments
    the past, “I remember when the ditch was full, and when the boys came
    to bathe in it and were sometimes drowned in it. Then fish abounded
    and men angled from the bank.” We begin our walk. “I remember,” our
    guide goes on, talking while he leads the way, “running along the
    Wall when I was a boy, nearly sixty years ago. It was a favourite
    pastime to run from gate to gate. That was before the suppression of
    the Religious.” He sighed—Was he then regretting that event? “All
    the Houses were standing then. One thought they would stand for ever.
    Yet the axe was already laid to the tree: there was internal decay
    and external contempt, though we boys knew nothing of it. The friars
    in vain searched the boxes put up for them in the shops: no one would
    give them alms; if they went into a house, no one would give them so
    much as a crust of bread; there were but fifteen left in Grey Friars,
    and they were selling their vessels of silver and gold when they were
    called upon to surrender. But still their churches made a brave show.
    All day long the bells were ringing—’twas a city of bells. They rang
    from cathedral and parish church; from monastery and nunnery; from
    college of priests and from chapel and from spital. They rang for
    festivals and fasts; for pageants and ridings; for births and deaths;
    for marriages and funerals; for the election of City officers; for the
    King’s birthday; for the day and the hour; they rang in the baby; they
    rang out the passing soul; they rang merrily in honour of the bride;
    they rang for work to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> begin and for work to cease; the streets echoed
    the ringing of bells all day long; for miles round London you could
    hear with the singing of the larks the ringing of the bells.</p>

  <p>“A third part of the City belonged to the Houses and the Church.
    Why, thousands of honest people lived by working for St. Paul’s and
    the parish churches and the monks and nuns. Look around you now.”
    We were close to Aldgate. Stow pointed to the south-east. Near
    the Tower stood a venerable church in a precinct surrounded by a
    stone wall and containing a cloister, houses round it, a garden, a
    school-house, and a burial-ground. “Behold the last of them!” he said.
    “St. Katherine’s, the smallest of all the Foundations, still exists;
    but changed—Ah!—changed. Where are the rest?” On the north of St.
    Katherine’s was another precinct marked out by a wall, and within it
    broken walls, broken windows, and rough timber store-houses. “There
    was once Eastminster,” said Stow. “Who is mindful of our Lady of Grace
    and her Cistercians? They are forgotten. Look Citywards. Yon ruins are
    those of the Crutched Friars. What is left to mark their abode of two
    hundred years and more? Their hall was converted into a glass-house
    and is burned down; their church contains now a carpenter’s shop and
    a tennis court. Turn your eyes more to the north. Those are the ruins
    of St. Helen’s Nunnery: their chapel is part of the parish church;
    their hall is now the Hall of the Leathersellers’ Company; their
    gardens also belong to that honourable Company. Or yonder, where you
    may behold the precinct of the Holy Trinity Priory. The Prior was also
    Alderman of Portsoken Ward and rode among the other Aldermen, but in
    habit ecclesiastical, as I myself have seen. The House kept open table
    for rich and poor; a noble and hospitable House it was, but in the end
    decayed by reason of too great hospitality. The church was pulled down
    and levelled with the ground—<i>Proh Pudor!</i>—the courts remain, but
    with other buildings; and now is that venerable and regal Foundation
    clean forgotten. Behold”—he pointed outside the Wall—“the place where
    the <i>Sorores Minores</i>, the sisters of St. Clare, lived for many years.
    The walls of their refectory still stand; on the site of their cloister
    is a fair and large store-house for armours and habiliments of war,
    with work-houses serving unto the same purpose. Alas! Poor Sisters! To
    this end has come their House of Peace and Prayer.”</p>

  <p>“Nevertheless, Master Stow, the City is more prosperous than before.”</p>

  <p>“I know not; I know not,” he said impatiently. “What do I know about
    wealth and prosperity? Let us go on.” So he left off talking about the
    churches and monasteries and pointed to the houses beyond the Wall.
    “The suburbs,” he said, “have not greatly increased of late years.
    There has been too much plague among us. And, indeed, it would seem
    that we are never to be rid of plague. The Queen’s Council forbade the
    building of new houses. As well forbid the
    rising of the tide. There
    are now—as you can plainly see—a line of cottages on both sides of
    the road as far as Whitechapel Church. But who is to hinder? There
    is a line of houses along the riverside as far as Ratcliffe and even
    Limehouse, where once were elms so noble. But who is there to hinder?
    Masterless men are they, and sea-faring men and common cheats and
    rogues, who live beside the river, beyond the jurisdiction of the Mayor
    and safe from the wholesome cart tail and the penance of pillory.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>“Pleasant it was, in those old days,” he went on, “to overlook the
    quiet nuns from the Wall. There were no whispers against those holy
    Sisters, and no scandals. We loved to look upon them in their gardens
    quiet and peaceful. They prayed for the City, the nuns of St. Clare,
    of St. Helen’s, and of Holywell. Now every man prays for himself.
    There were also the monks in their cloisters, walking and reading and
    meditating. Some there were who called the monks devourers and drones.
    I know not. Their prayers were asked for the dead and for the living.
    No one prays now for the dead, and no one asks where they lie or how
    they fare. Drones and devourers! They were gentlemen all by birth,—why
    should they work?”</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, surprising to see the ruins of the Houses, nor had I
    understood, until I walked round the Wall and observed the ruins, how
    many there were, or how great was the destruction when the masterful
    King turned out the monks and nuns and gave their houses to his
    favourites and his courtiers. “They have taken” said Stow, “all they
    wanted of the stones. What are left will vanish little by little.”</p>

  <p>“But the memory will continue.”</p>

  <p>“Nay, in the minds of scholars, not of the people. Things of the past
    are soon forgotten. No one will teach the children about the Houses of
    monks and friars. If they teach them anything at all, it will be as
    Barnabe Googe taught his generation when he gathered into one volume
    all that could be alleged or invented against those holy men, if they
    were holy,” he added, correcting himself. “Indeed a man must pay heed
    unto his words. I have been, myself, charged with Romish leanings
    because I remember things that are past and gone. What do the young
    folk now understand of what they have lost, because they never saw it?
    I am now old, and in age the mind flies back willingly to the days of
    youth.”</p>

  <p>Within the Wall we saw the ruins of the Crutched Friars, of St.
    Helen’s, of the Holy Priory, of the Austin Friars, of the Papey, of
    Elsing Spital, of St. James’s in the Wall, of the Grey Friars and of
    the Black Friars; without the Wall there were the ruins of Eastminster,
    of the Clares, of St. Mary Spital, of Holywell, of the Church House, of
    the Knights Hospitallers, of Clerkenwell Nunnery, of St. Bartholomew’s
    Priory, and of the White Friars.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

  <p>“The poets, doubtless,” I said, “and with them the divines, meditate
    among these ruins.”</p>

  <p>“Alas! No. The poets write songs of love and sing them; or they go
    forth to the wars and sing of them. The times are brisk. It is as if
    the world was waking up from sleep: there are new things everywhere;
    we live in the present; our ships go forth to distant lands; there is
    a new world, a Terra Incognita, to be explored and conquered; it is no
    time for meditation. When the cloister was broken down meditation fled
    beyond the seas. We live to fight and to get rich, and to watch against
    the wiles of Pope and Spaniard.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>“Do these ruins then inspire no regret?”</p>

  <p>“None. The people are forgetting fast. Only old men sometimes speak
    of what they remember; when the last stones have been taken away, the
    very names will tell them nothing. Even the names are changing. Soon
    all will be lost and forgotten. Strange! Four hundred years those monks
    lived among us, and after fifty years they are already clean forgotten
    as much as if they had never lived.”</p>

  <p>At Bishopsgate, Stow pointed northward. “Houses,” he said, “are
    stretching along the northern road, but slowly. Among the ruins of
    Holywell stands a Play house, and outside it is another. What will
    be the end of this passion for the theatre, I know not. Formerly, an
    interlude in an Inn yard, a masque in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> Company’s Hall, and so enough.
    Now have ye every day a play set forth upon a stage, with songs and
    music, and boys dressed up as women.”</p>

  <p>He shook his head and led on, still following the Wall. Within the
    City on this north side there were many large and fair gardens, some
    belonging to Companies which here have their Halls, and some to
    merchants’ houses, and some that once belonged to the Monastic Houses.
    They were set with fruit-trees and with beds of flowers and sweet
    herbs. Among the gardens stood collections of craftsmen’s cottages and
    workshops, and the churches with their small green churchyards were
    almost hidden by the trees. This part of London truly had a rural look
    by reason of these gardens.</p>

  <p>We passed Moorgate, the old church of the Papey close to the Wall,
    and further along, also close to the Wall, the church of All Hallows;
    we came to Cripplegate with its church outside the Wall. And passing
    a bend to the south, continued our walk. On the other side of the
    ditch was another double line of houses. “This is Aldersgate,” said
    Stow. “The way leads to the Charter House and beyond to the village
    of Iseldon. You can now see the ruins of the House of the Knights
    Hospitallers; their noble gate yet stands, and part of their church.
    Beyond was the Priory of St. Bartholomew. From the Wall you may behold
    their cloisters; the chancel of their church is now a parish church.
    Close at hand is Smithfield. What things have been done at Smithfield!
    I was thirty years of age when Queen Mary burned her martyrs. There had
    been burnings before her time, but she outdid them all. Sir, she was
    ill-advised: she thought to make the people go back to the old Religion
    through fear. She might have led them back through love. I have seen
    the burning of those stubborn folk. Old and young, men and women, nay
    children, have I seen standing in the faggots, praying aloud while the
    flames mounted up and licked their hands and their faces. Mostly they
    died quickly, being smothered with the smoke; but sometimes the flames
    were blown away, and we saw the blackened body still in agony, and the
    lips that moved to the end in prayer. And we saw how the Lord answered,
    giving fortitude to endure or even, if we knew it, painlessness in the
    midst of fire. To see father, brother, neighbour, so die without fear,
    and as if joyously enduring torture in order to reach the gates of
    Heaven,—Believe me, sir, this it was that made the people what they
    are, and completed Henry’s work.”</p>

  <p>We came to Newgate. “Behold!” he said, “the cat, emblem of Whittington,
    who rebuilt this gate and prison. Here is Christ’s Hospital, which once
    was the House of the Grey Friars. It is London’s chiefest glory: here
    shall you find boys ruled with wisdom and taught godliness, who would
    otherwise have joined the throngs of the masterless, and roamed about
    the streets and roads.” And so on to Ludgate, where we left the Wall.
    “See,” said Stow, “there are houses with many palaces of nobles all
    the way from Bridewell to the King’s House at Westminster. And now,
    good sir, we leave the Wall, and we will visit the City within the
    Wall.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>He led me by Ludgate into the precinct of St. Paul’s, surrounded by
    a stone wall; the Cathedral looked battered and worn by the tooth of
    time; the spire, once the glory of the City, was gone never to be
    replaced; the stonework was black in parts from the smoke of the sea
    coal; the tracery was mouldering; about the towers of the west flew the
    swifts crying. “There are kites on the roof,” said Stow, “which keep
    the City clean and devour the offal.”</p>

    <div class="caption">LATIMER PREACHING BEFORE EDWARD VI. AT WESTMINSTER<br />
      E. Gardner’s Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>At Paul’s Cross there was a preaching by some reverend divine: a crowd
    of women sat on benches listening; a few men were there, but it was in
    working hours. The preacher argued some difficult point of doctrine,
    comparing texts and turning over the leaves of his small brown Geneva
    Bible. I observed that his hearers listened with a critical air. “For
    fifty years,” said Stow, looking on with contempt, “they have been
    arguing and disputing on matters of doctrine and nothing settled yet;
    in the old time we were told what to believe, and we were stayed and
    comforted by our belief. These people prove one thing to-day and
    another thing to-morrow. They are pulled this way and that by the
    power of texts which they think they understand. Let us go into the
    Cathedral.”</p>

    <div class="caption">SOUTH FRONT OF BAYNARD’S CASTLE, ABOUT 1640</div>
  </div>

  <p>Outside, in the churchyard, everything was destroyed that formerly made
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
    place venerable and beautiful: Pardon churchyard; the “Clochard;”
    the cloister with the Dance of Death; Sherrington’s Library; the
    college of the minor canons. Only Paul’s Cross remained. And the
    Cathedral, rising up alone and gaunt, bereft of her daughters, seemed
    mournful and lonely. “Perhaps,” said Stow, “a new church is wanted for
    the new Faith. St. Paul’s was not built for Protestants. They know not
    how to treat the church. Look at yonder fellows!” He pointed to two
    porters who bore boxes on their heads, and entering at the North doors
    tramped noisily through the Cathedral, going out at the South. “They
    have made a right of way, a short way, through the church. Saw one ever
    the like? Through the church itself!”</p>

  <p>We went in; the nave was a kind of noisy Exchange, yet not for
    merchants. It was full of people loudly talking of all kinds of
    business; ladies were there. “They make their assignations in the
    church,” said Stow. Gallants richly dressed swaggered up and down the
    middle aisle; servants stood waiting to be hired; scriveners had their
    stools and tables, and were busy writing letters; men disputed over
    their affairs, yea, and quarrelled loudly. The chancel was walled off
    and separated from the nave and transepts. The old glory had departed
    from the once splendid interior: of all the chapels, shrines, altars,
    chantries, paintings, lights, carved marbles, work in ivory, gold
    and silver, nothing was left. Only bare whitewashed walls and a few
    plain tombs; even the painted glass, wherever it could be reached,
    was broken. While we looked around the organ began to play; it was
    accompanied by other instruments, chiefly wind instruments. With the
    music ascended the voices of the choir, the pure sweet voices of the
    boys. My old guide’s eyes grew humid. “No,” he said, “they have not
    taken all away. The music remains with us, to remind us that Heaven
    is left although we have whitewashed the paintings that revealed its
    glories.”</p>

  <p>We left the precinct by the North gate, which opens upon the back of
    St. Michael le Querne, and turned eastward into Chepe. The breadth
    of this great market had contracted since the reign of Edward the
    Third. The houses on the south side were much higher and better built,
    with timber frames and much carving and gilding. On the north side
    the lanes, which were formerly broad spaces for stands and sheds for
    the market, were now narrow, with houses on either hand: there were
    also houses on that side, but not continuous; here were Grocers’ Hall
    and Mercers’ Hall. Round the Standard and the Cross were stalls kept
    by women; the poulterers still had their shops in the Poultry, and
    apothecaries sold their drugs and herbs in Bucklersbury.</p>

  <p>It was now evening, and supper time. My guide led me to the tavern
    called the Rose, in the Poultry. There was a goodly company assembled
    in the great room. Here there was music, and the drawers ran about
    with supper and with wine. A capon with a flask of Malmsey warmed the
    heart of my old guide. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> supper we took tobacco and more wine,
    while boys sang madrigals very sweetly. The close of a summer day in
    the City of London brings with it a cessation of the noise of hammers
    and the ringing of anvils and the grinding of waggons and the shouts of
    those who quarrel over their work. The City became quiet; there was the
    tinkling of guitar and lute from the taverns and the houses; the voices
    of those who sang; the merry laugh of maidens, and the sober voice of
    age.</p>

  <p>“Come,” said Stow, “there remains the Royal Exchange. This we will see
    and so an end until to-morrow.”</p>

  <p>The Royal Exchange was lit up with candles. The upper walk or
    <i>pawne</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I found to be a collection of shops, all as light as day.
    Music was playing and the place was full of people; not the sober
    merchants, but the City madams and their daughters, the gallants, and
    the ’prentices. “In the summer,” said Stow, “the place is open till
    nine of the clock, in the winter till ten. Many come here just as they
    go to Paul’s in the morning, because they have no other place to go to
    and no money to spend in the tavern. Know you not the lines?</p>

      </div>

  <p>Other walks, many other walks, I have taken about London in company
    of good old John Stow: we have walked together along Thames Street,
    which is surely the very heart of the City, and in Chepe, and among
    the gardens of the northern part. In these walks about the streets,
    even then so old and so venerable, the old man waxed eloquent over the
    houses of the past where the great nobles had each his palace, which
    was also a barrack in the City of London. It was not only in and about
    Thames Street: all over the City he led me, prattling in his kindly
    garrulity. “There were kings’ palaces here once,” he said: “the Tower
    Royal where Richard’s mother dwelt; and the King’s Wardrobe—I can show
    you that; and Baynard’s Castle, which is now rebuilt and remains a
    noble house; and Crosby Hall, where the third Richard sojourned for a
    while; and the Stone House in Lombard Street that they call King John’s
    Palace, but I know not with what truth; and Cold Harbour where Prince
    Hal once lived; and the Savoy which was John of Gaunt’s. And there
    were the town houses of the noblemen. What a stately house was that of
    the Northumberlands outside Aldgate! It is now a printing-house. And
    they had another house in Aldgate Ward with broad gardens, now turned
    into bowling-greens. And there is the house called the Erber on the
    east side of Dowgate. The Earl of Warwick had it, then the Duke of
    Clarence had it, and when it was rebuilt Francis Drake had it. There is
    Gresham’s Mansion in Broad Street, which has become a noble college for
    the instruction of youths in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>liberal arts, so that some say that
    London will become like unto Oxford or Cambridge. And Whittington’s
    house beside the church of St. Michael, now an almshouse, which was
    once also a college for priests. And there is the house which once
    belonged to Sir Robert Large, when Caxton was his ’prentice, at the
    corner of Old Jewry; formerly it was a Jews’ Synagogue, and afterwards
    the House of the Brethren of the Sack. Alas! most of these houses
    are now in decay and inhabited by poor folk. The nobles come no more
    to town.” Yet he showed me the house of Sir Francis Walsingham, the
    Queen’s Secretary. It was in Seething Lane. “We look for these palaces
    now, along the river, between Bridewell and Westminster,” he said.</p>

    <div class="caption">WEST CHEPE IN ELIZABETHAN LONDON</div>
  </div>

  <p>My old guide looked at the people as they passed with a peculiar
    benevolence, especially upon the young. “I have myself been a
    ’prentice,” he said; “I know the rubs and crosses of that time; an
    impatient master, long hours of work, hard fare, hot blood that longs
    to be up and doing. Many there are who have in their latter days broken
    their indentures and fled to sail the seas with Oxenham or Drake; many
    have gone into the service of the adventurous Companies. I remember
    very well, very well,” he sighed, “the joys of the time, the dancing
    on a summer evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> the wrestling, the fighting, the pageants and
    ridings in the streets. Life lies all before the ’prentice. What boots
    it to be my Lord Mayor when life is wellnigh spent?”</p>

  <p>“Sir,” my guide added, “I have shown you our City. Go now, alone, and
    watch the ways of the people: mark the wealth of our merchants; look at
    the Port crowded with ships and the Quays cumbered with merchandise;
    talk with the mariners, and observe the spirit that is in them all.
    Like all old men I lament the past; but I needs must rejoice in the
    quickening of these latter days. And so, good sir, farewell.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Let</span> us supplement this discourse by contemporary evidence.</p>

  <p>There is an anonymous map of London in the sixteenth century called
    “Londinium Feracissimi Angliæ Regni Metropolis.” It is in some respects
    more exact than the better known map attributed to Agas. The streets,
    gardens, and fields are laid down with greater precision, and there is
    no serious attempt to combine, as Agas does, a picture, or a panorama,
    with a map. At the same time, the surveyor has been unable to resist
    the fashion of his time to consider the map as laid down from a
    bird’s-eye view, so that he thinks it necessary to give something of
    elevation.</p>

  <p>I will take that part of the map which lies outside the walls. The
    precinct of St. Katherine stands beside the Tower with its chapel,
    court, and gardens; there are a few houses near it, apparently
    farmhouses; the convent of Eastminster had entirely vanished. Nothing
    indicates the site of the Nunnery in the Minories; yet there were ruins
    of these buildings standing here till the end of the last century;
    outside Bishopsgate houses extended past St. Mary Spital, some of whose
    buildings were still, apparently, standing. On the west side St. Mary
    of Bethlehem stood, exactly on the site of Liverpool Street Station,
    but not covering nearly so large an area; it appears to have occupied a
    single court and was probably what we should now consider a very pretty
    little cottage, like St. Edmund’s Hall, Oxford.</p>

  <p>Outside Cripplegate the houses begin again, leaving, between, the
    lower Moorfields dotted with ponds; there are houses lining the road
    outside Aldersgate. The courts are still standing of St. Bartholomew’s
    Priory, Charter House, St. John’s Priory, and the Clerkenwell Nunnery;
    Smithfield is surrounded with houses; Bridewell with its two square
    courts stands upon the river bank; Fleet Street is irregular in shape,
    the houses being nowhere in line; the courts of Whitefriars are still
    remaining. The Strand has all its great houses facing the river; their
    backs open upon a broad street with a line of mean houses on the north
    side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> On the south of the river there is a line of houses on the High
    Street; a line of houses along the river bank on either side; and
    another one running near Bermondsey Abbey.</p>

  <p>Within the walls we observe that some of the Religious Houses have
    quite disappeared; Crutched Friars, for instance; there is a vacant
    space which is probably one of the courts of St. Helen’s; the Priory
    of the Holy Trinity preserves its courts, but there is no sign of
    the church; there are still visible the courts and gardens of Austin
    Friars; there is still the great court of the Grey Friars; but the
    buildings of Blackfriars seem to have vanished entirely.</p>

  <p>But Sir Thomas More has left us a description of London in his time. It
    is a description in terms too vague, yet interesting. He calls the City
    Amaurote and the Thames he calls the Anyder.</p>

  <p>“The River Anyder riseth four and twenty miles above Amaurote, out of
    a little spring: but being increased by other small floods and brooks
    that run into it: and, among others, two somewhat bigger ones. Before
    the City, it is half a mile broad (hardly so much now as it was in
    former days being pent in and straitned to a narrower space, by the
    later buildings on each side): and further, broader. By all that space
    that lyeth between the Sea and the City, and a good sort of land also
    above, the water ebbs and flows six hours together, with a swift tide;
    when the sea flows in to the length of thirty miles, it fills all the
    Anyder with salt water, and drives back the fresh water of the river;
    and somewhat further, it hangeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
    the sweetness of fresh water with
    saltness: but a little beyond that, the river waxeth sweet, and runneth
    foreby the City fresh and pleasant; and when the sea ebbs and goes back
    again, this fresh water follows it almost to the very fall into the sea.</p>

    <div class="caption">LONDINIUM FERACISSIMI ANGLIÆ REGNI METROPOLIS</div>
  </div>

  <p>They have also another river, which indeed is not very great, but it
    runneth gently and pleasantly: for it riseth even out of the same hill
    that the City standeth upon, and runneth down slope through the midst
    of the City into Anyder.” [This may be the river of the Wells; in
    More’s time the Walbrook was probably covered over.] “And because it
    ariseth a little without the City, the Amaurotians have enclosed the
    head spring of it with strong fences and bulwarks; and so have joined
    it to the City: this done, to the intent that the waters should not be
    stopped nor turned away, nor poisoned, if their enemies should chance
    to come upon them. From thence the water is derived and brought down in
    Chanals or Brooks divers ways into the lower parts of the City. Where
    that cannot be done by reason that the place will not suffer it, then
    they gather the Rain Water in great Cisterns which doth them as good
    service.” [This, it seems, was all the supply of Water the City had in
    that age, which is now much more plentifully served.] “Then next for
    the situation and Walls. That it stood by the side of a low Hill, in
    fashion almost square. The breadth of it began a little beneath the
    top of the Hill, and still continued by the space of two miles, until
    it came to the river Anyder. The length of it, which lyeth by the
    river-side, was somewhat more.</p>

  <p>The City is compassed about with an high and thick wall, full of
    Turrets and Bulwarks. A dry Ditch, but deep and broad and overgrown
    with bushes, briers, and thorns, goeth about three sides or quarters of
    the City. To the fourth side, the River itself serveth for a Ditch.</p>

  <p>The streets be appointed and set forth very commodious and handsome,
    both for carriage and also against the winds. The Streets be full
    twenty foot broad. The Houses be of fair and gorgeous Buildings: and in
    the street-side, they stand joined together in a long Row through the
    whole Street, without any partition or separation. On the bankside of
    the Houses, through the whole length of the Street, lye large Gardens
    which be closed in round about with the back parts of the Street. Every
    House hath two doors, one to the street, and a Postern Door on the
    backside into the Garden. These doors be made with two leaves, never
    locked nor bolted: so easie to be opened, that they will follow the
    least drawing of a finger, and shut again of themselves.</p>

  <p>They set great store by their gardens. In these they have Vineyards
    and all manner of Fruits, Herbs, and Flowers, so pleasant, so well
    furnished, and so finely kept, that I never saw anything more fruitful,
    nor better trimmed in any place: and their study and diligence
    herein cometh not only of pleasure, but also of a certain strife
    and contention that is betwixt street and street, concerning the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
    trimming, husbanding, and flourishing, of their Gardens, every man
    for his own part: and verily, you shall not lightly find in all the
    City anything that is more commodious, either for the Profit of the
    Citizens, or for pleasure. And therefore it may seem, that the first
    founder of the City minded nothing so much as he did these Gardens.
    They say, that King Utopus himself, even at his first beginning,
    appointed and drew forth the platform of the City into this fashion and
    figure that it hath now, by his gallant garnishing and the beautiful
    setting forth of it. Whereunto he saw that one man’s age would not
    suffice, that he left to his posterity.</p>

  <p>Their Chronicles, which they keep written with all diligent
    circumspection, containing the history of 1760 years, even from the
    first conquest of the Island, record and witness, that the Houses
    in the beginning were very low, and likely homely cottages, or poor
    shepherds’ houses, made at all adventures of every rude piece of wood
    that came first to hand: with Mud-walls, and ridged Roofs thatched over
    with straw. But now the Houses be curiously builded after a gorgeous
    and gallant sort, with three stories, one over another.</p>

  <p>The outside of the walls be made of either hard Flint, or of Plaister,
    or else of Brick: and the Inner-sides be well strengthened with
    Timber-Work.</p>

  <p>The Roofs be plain and flat, covered with a certain kind of Plaister
    that is of no cost: and yet so tempered that no fire can hurt or perish
    it: and notwithstandeth the violence of the weather, better than any
    lead.</p>

  <p>They keep the wind out of their windows with glass: for it is there
    much used: and some were also with fine linnen dipped in oyl or amber:
    and that for two commodities: for by this means more light cometh in,
    and the wind is better kept out.” (<i>Utopia.</i>)</p>

  <p>The following notes on England were written by one Stephen Perlin in
    1558. The tract was translated for, and published in, the <i>Antiquarian
      Repertory</i> (vol. iv.):—</p>

  <p>“The English in general are cheerful and great lovers of music, for
    there is no church, however small, but has musical service performed in
    it. They are likewise great drunkards; for if an Englishman would treat
    you, he will say in his language, <i>yis dring a quarta rim gasquim cim
      hespaignol, oim malvoysi</i>; that is, will you drink a quart of Gascoigne
    wine, another of Spanish, and another Malmsy. In drinking or eating
    they will say to you above an hundred times, <i>drind iou</i>, which is, I
    am going to drink to you; and you should answer them in their language,
    <i>iplaigiu</i>, which means, I pledge you. If you would thank them in their
    language you must say, <i>god tanque artelay</i>, which is to say, I thank
    you with all my heart. When they are drunk, they will swear blood and
    death that you shall drink all that is in your cup, and will say thus
    to you, <i>bigod sol drind iou agoud oin</i>. Now remember, if you please,
    that in this land they commonly make <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>use of silver vessels when
    they drink wine, and they will say to you at table, <i>goud chere</i>, which
    is good cheer. The servants wait on their master bareheaded, and leave
    their caps on the buffet. It is to be noted, that in this excellent
    kingdom there is, as I have said, no kind of order; the people are
    reprobates, and thorough enemies to good manners and letters, for they
    don’t know whether they belong to God or the Devil, which St. Paul had
    reprehended in so many people, saying, be not transported with divers
    sorts of winds, but be constant and steady to your belief.</p>

  <p>In this country, all the shops of every trade are open, like those
    of the barbers in France, and have many glass windows, as well below
    as above in the chambers, for in the chambers there are many glazed
    casements, and that in all the tradesmen’s houses in almost every town;
    and those houses are like the barbers’ shops in France, as well above
    as below, and glazed at their openings. In the windows, as well in
    cities as villages, are plenty of flowers, and at the taverns plenty of
    hay upon their wooden floors, and many cushions of tapestry, on which
    travellers seat themselves. There are many bishopricks in this kingdom,
    as I think sixteen, and some archbishopricks, of which one is esteemed
    the principal, which is Cantorbie, called in English Cantorberi, where
    there is a very fine church, of which St. Thomas is patron. England
    is remarkable for all sorts of fruits, as apricots, peaches, and
    quantities of nuts.”</p>

  <p>In the year 1598 a German traveller, Paul Hentzner by name, visited
    London. This is what he says about the streets:—</p>

  <p>“The streets in this city are very handsome and clean; but that which
    is named from the goldsmiths who inhabit it, surpasses all the rest:
    there is in it a gilt tower, with a fountain that plays. Near it on the
    farther side is a handsome house, built by a goldsmith, and presented
    by him to the city. There are besides to be seen in this street, as in
    all others where there are goldsmiths’ shops, all sorts of gold and
    silver vessels exposed to sale, as well as ancient and modern medals,
    in such quantities as must surprise a man the first time he sees and
    considers them.” (<i>See</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix VI.</a>)</p>

  <p>Stow furnishes a very clear account of the condition of the suburbs in
    his own time. Thus, he says that outside the Wall in the East there
    were no houses at all east of St. Katherine’s along the river until the
    middle of the sixteenth century, but that during the latter half of
    the century there had sprung up a “continual street, or filthy strait
    passage, with alleys of small tenements built, inhabited by sailors;
    victuallers, along by the river of Thames, almost to Ratcliff, a good
    mile from the Tower.”</p>

  <p>He says, further, that in his time had arisen quite a new suburb
    between East Smithfield and Limehouse; and that good houses had been
    recently built between Ratcliff and Blackwall.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

  <p>Outside Aldgate he mentions a “large street replenished with buildings
    to Hog Lane and the bars. Without the bars both sides of the street
    were ‘pestered’ with cottages and alleys, even up to Whitechapel
    Church and almost half a mile beyond it into the common field.” Note,
    therefore, that close to Aldgate, just beyond Whitechapel Church, was a
    common which was thus encroached upon and settled on by squatters and
    by those who made enclosures and placed laystalls, etc., upon them.
    The whole of the common was thus taken up; “in some places it scarce
    remaineth a sufficient highway for the meeting of carriages and droves
    of people,” a fact to be remembered and accounted for.</p>

    <div class="caption">BISHOPSGATE</div>
  </div>

  <p>Going on to Bishopsgate and its highway. Outside the gate stood St.
    Botolph’s Church; next to it the Hospital of St. Mary of Bethlehem;
    opposite certain houses; then, the liberty of Norton Folgate, belonging
    to the canons of St. Paul’s; then the site of the Holywell Nunnery;
    all along the road to St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, except for the site
    of St. Mary Spital, a “continual building of small and base tenements,
    for the most part lately erected.” Among the cottages Stow points to a
    certain row whose history was perhaps that of many others. The row of
    cottages were almshouses belonging to St. Mary Spital; the occupants
    were appointed by that House; they paid a yearly rent of one penny, in
    acknowledgment of ownership; and on Christmas Day they were feasted by
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> Prior. When the Hospital was suppressed the cottages, for want of
    repairs, fell into decay; the new owners of the land would not take
    over the responsibility of the charitable endowment; they neither
    repaired the houses nor did they invite the tenants to a Christmas
    feast. On the other hand, they did not collect the rent of a penny.
    They were then sold, although they ought to have been continued as
    almhouses to one Russell, who rebuilt them and gave them his own name,
    and let them to tenants in the usual way.</p>

  <p>The church of St. Leonard’s contained monuments to the memory of three
    noble families at least: the Westmoreland Nevilles; the Blounts, Lords
    Mountjoy; and that of Manners, Earls of Rutland. The reason of their
    tombs and monuments being found in the church must be sought in the
    history of the manors lying north of Shoreditch.</p>

  </div>

  <p>On the north side of the City the Moor Fields continued for a long time
    as waste ground, seldom visited; in 1415, however, Thomas Fawconer,
    Mayor, broke through the City Wall and built the postern called
    Moorgate; he constructed causeways over the Moor; cleansed and repaired
    the dykes or ditches with which the Moor was intersected: so that the
    place was drained and made into a pleasant walk for the citizens,
    either on summer evenings, or on their way to Iselden and Hoxton.
    Sixty years later brickfields were opened in the Moor, and bricks made
    for the repair of the City Wall. Then citizens began to make and to
    enclose gardens in the Moor; in 1498 these were all taken away and an
    archery-field made in their place. In 1512 more dykes were made for the
    drainage of the Moor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> and in 1527 conduits were constructed to carry
    the waters over the Tower Ditch into the Walbrook. The point is that in
    the sixteenth century the whole of the ground lying between Moorgate
    and Bishopsgate was unoccupied by houses. The map already referred to
    shows the road running north from Moorgate, and the Moor itself crossed
    by causeways: in the east a broad ditch crossed by bridges falls into
    the Tower Ditch.</p>

  <p>The Moor formerly extended beyond Cripplegate and as far as the Fleet
    River; it was built upon by the Religious Houses; St. Bartholomew’s
    Priory and Hospital; the Charter House; the Priory of St. John; and
    the Nunnery of Clerkenwell. Between these houses and the wall were St.
    Giles’s Church, St. Botolph’s Church, Fore Street, Whitecross Street,
    and other streets, making a suburb with a population in the sixteenth
    century of 1800 householders, or 9000 souls. The last bit of the Moor
    left on the north-west of the City was brickfield.</p>

  <p>We now come to the western suburb: the earliest settled and the most
    thickly populated of all. Fleet Street and the streets north of it,
    however, belonged to the Ward of Farringdon Without.</p>

  <p>We are now in a position to show other reasons why the extension of the
    City was so slow and so limited.</p>

  <p>All round the City lay manors and estates belonging for the most part
    to the Church. St. Paul’s Cathedral possessed a great many of these
    manors; the Bishop possessed many; St. Peter’s, Westminster, possessed
    many. Finsbury, Shoreditch, Hoxton, Iselden, St. Pancras, Willesden,
    belonged to St. Paul’s. The manor of St. Peter stretched all the way
    from Millbank to the Fleet River, and from the Thames to Holborn. These
    estates belonged to the Church; when the City received the County of
    Middlesex to farm, it did not receive these manors, and the owners had
    their rights. Foremost among these rights was that they were outside
    the jurisdiction of the City; the land could not be built upon without
    permission of the owners; what the City got was the inclusion of that
    part of the land outside the Wall which was bounded and defined by
    the Bars: that is to say, it included, without the Wall—(1) The Ward
    of Portsoken, formerly the lands of the Cnihten Gild; (2) The Common
    Land of Whitechapel; (3) The Common Land of the Moor as far as to the
    Fleet River, and (4) The Ward of Farringdon Without. Why did it go no
    farther? Because at every point beyond these limits the manors of the
    Church were met. At first the encroachments of the City authorities
    into the manors met with no opposition; perhaps the ecclesiastics felt
    that it was well to have the people on their lands well governed; on
    one occasion the City acquired rights by taking a manor on lease, as
    that of Mora di Halliwell in 1315. In other cases the ecclesiastics
    interfered and made it impossible for more houses to be built on their
    lands, save on their own terms, and without acknowledgment by the City
    Authority.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

  <p>For these reasons, therefore,—the limited jurisdiction of the City;
    the steady opposition of the ecclesiastical owners of the manors
    outside; and the slow growth of the population,—there was little
    increase save in the direction of Bishopsgate Street Without, where the
    City had a lease of the manor, until the Dissolution of the Religious
    Houses and the change of owners in the manors.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was never a time when the sober citizen was more sober, more
    responsible, more filled with a sense of his authority and dignity.

  <p>They did stand before princes, these merchants of London; as their
    prosperity leaped up increasingly year after year, they became the
    creditors, at least, of princes, for Elizabeth borrowed freely and
    repaid unwillingly—yet in spite of this too notorious weakness, she
    retained to the end the deepest affection of her people.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

  <p>It has been a matter of reproach to the City that it seemed at this
    time wholly given over to trade and the interests of trade. To reproach
    a city which has always been a trading city with caring chiefly for the
    interests of trade seems somewhat unreasonable. But is it true that
    London has ever been wholly devoted to trade? I cannot find such a time
    in the whole long history of the City: certainly not in the reign of
    Elizabeth, when London cheerfully raised her men and her ships for the
    repulse of the Armada; and cheerfully gave the Queen whatever money she
    asked for; at the same time, while trade became larger than before,
    while the individual merchants became of more importance, the City
    certainly lost some of its political importance and was less dreaded,
    while it was more caressed, by the Sovereign.</p>

  <p>It was, moreover, with the better class, a deeply religious age;
    men were not afraid or ashamed of proclaiming, or of showing, their
    religion. When Francis Drake saw the Atlantic on one side and the
    Pacific on the other, he fell on his knees in the sight of the company
    and prayed aloud, that God would suffer him to sail upon that unknown
    sea: if a cutpurse was hanged, he never failed to make a moving speech,
    deeply religious, while on the ladder. All classes preserved as yet the
    Catholic practice of going often to church; they studied the Bible;
    they made their ’prentices attend services; they listened patiently
    to sermons; doctrine was considered a vital point. By the end of the
    sixteenth century those who favoured the old Faith were either dead
    or silenced; to the common people the old Faith meant a return to the
    flames in Smithfield; torture at the hands of the Spanish Inquisition
    if any should haply fall into Spanish hands; and slavery under the
    Spanish King should he achieve the conquest of the country; whereas the
    new Faith meant freedom of thought, increased wealth, advancing trade,
    fighting the Spaniard and capturing the Spanish galleons. Religion,
    therefore, was allied with prosperity.</p>

  <p>I have spoken of the sober guise of the London merchant. That sober
    guise belonged to the places where the merchant was mostly found: to
    the Royal Exchange, for instance, or Thames Street, beside the quays
    and warehouses. We must not think that there was no longer brightness
    of colour and even splendour in the streets. The rich liveries of the
    great nobles were chiefly seen on the river—remember that the front
    of the Palace faced the river, that the back belonged to the Strand,
    and that the river was London’s principal highway. Their varlets
    lolled about on the river stairs or escorted their master in his
    barge, but hardly belonged to the City. A Court gallant was dressed
    as extravagantly as he could afford, or as his estate would bear. He
    carried manors on his back, broad acres in his velvet cloak, with
    golden buckles and lace trimming, a year’s rents in his fantastic
    doublet slashed and puffed, in his silken hose, in his splendid sword,
    his scabbard and the handle set with gold, in his rings, his scents,
    his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> gloves and in his chains. But the Court gallant seldom showed on
    Thames Street.</p>

  <p>In Norman and Plantagenet London there were no shops, nor was there
    anything sold in the streets except in the market-places, and the
    streets set aside for retail trade. But in the Tudor time Street Cries
    had already begun. We find, for instance, the following pleasant
    verses:—</p>

  <p>Sumptuary laws were constantly renewed and continually broken. Yet the
    mass of the people obeyed the unwritten law by which a man’s station
    was shown by his dress. For more on this subject see the Chapter on
    Dress.</p>

  <p>The ordering of the household was strict. Early hours were kept; in
    summer servants and apprentices were up at five; in winter at six
    or seven; there were rules as to attendance at morning and evening
    prayers; there was to be no quarrelling; no striking; no profane
    language.</p>

  <p>It is said that coaches were introduced in this reign; but there had
    always been coaches, <i>i.e.</i> wheeled conveyances of a kind. Such a
    carriage, belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> to the fourteenth century, is figured in J. J.
    Jusserand’s <i>English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages</i>—a cumbrous
    unwieldy thing, yet still a coach. What really happened in this century
    was the introduction of a much more convenient kind of coach from
    Holland.</p>

  <p>Stow laments the mud and the splashing in the streets. “The coachman
    rideth behind the horse tails, lasheth them, and looketh not behind
    him; the drayman sitteth and sleepeth on his dray and letteth his horse
    lead him home.” Most of the City streets, however, were so narrow and
    so much obstructed by houses standing out, for as yet there was no
    alignment except in streets like Chepe, which were highways and market

  <p>There was very little more lighting at night than there had been in the
    preceding centuries. If a London dame ventured out of the house after
    dark, the ’prentice carried a link before her. Some of the old shops or
    sheds with “solars” over them remained in Stow’s time; the last of them
    stood in Clare Market, and was pulled down a few years ago. See the
    accompanying photograph of it. Stow says that stalls had become sheds,
    <i>i.e.</i> roofed stalls; and then shops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> <i>i.e.</i> enclosed stalls; and then
    “fair houses.” He instances a block of houses called Goldsmiths’ Row,
    between Bread Street and the Cross, which contained ten dwelling-houses
    and fourteen shops, “all in one frame, uniformly built.” They were four
    stories high. The shops seem to have been open, but perhaps the upper
    part was protected with a shutter or with glass.</p>

  <p>Inland communication was conducted by means of carts and coaches.
    Harrison<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> complains of the new fashion: “Our Princes and the
    Nobilitie have their cariage commonlie made by carts, wherby it commeth
    to passe that when the Queene’s Majestie dooth remove from anie one
    place to another, there are usuallie 400 carewanes, which amount to the
    summe of 2400 horses, appointed out of the counties adjoining, whereby
    hir cariage is conveied safelie unto the appointed place. Hereby also
    the ancient use of sumpter horses is in maner utterlie relinquished,
    which causeth the traines of our princes in their progresses to shew
    far lesse than those of the kings of other nations.”</p>

  <p>During this long reign, in spite of plague and pestilence, the
    population of London increased, and the suburbs extended, as we have
    seen, in all directions. The increase of population was due (1) to
    the increase of trade in London, which required a great accession of
    ship-builders, boat-builders, makers of the various gear required for
    ships, seamen, lightermen, porters, stevedores, and the like; (2) to
    the large number of immigrants from France and the Low Countries; and
    (3) to the number of persons released from the Religious Houses. That
    is to say, this last is generally represented as one of the causes. To
    me it seems as if the influence of these people on the population of
    London must be regarded as quite insignificant. There were some 8000
    monks, nuns, and friars who were sent into the world. Many of those who
    were in priests’ orders obtained places in parish churches, conforming
    by degrees to the changes of doctrine; the monks and nuns had pensions;
    many of the latter went abroad; of the friars many were absorbed in the
    general population; a certain number, one knows not how many, refused
    to work, and joined the company of rogues and masterless men, but there
    seems nothing to show how many of them settled in London.</p>

  <p>Here is a simple calculation of the population in 1564. There was a
    great plague in that year. The total number of deaths in the City for
    the year is stated to have been 23,660, of whom 20,136 died of plague.
    This leaves 3524 deaths from ordinary causes. Now, if the average
    mortality of the City was twenty in the thousand, we should have a
    population of 176,200. If, which is more likely, the average mortality
    was twenty-five in the thousand the population was 140,960. In the time
    of King James, but after much devastation by the plague, the population
    of London was estimated at 130,000.</p>

  <p>It has been said that there is no street in London in which one cannot
    find <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>a church and a tree. It is indeed remarkable to observe the
    large number of trees still existing and flourishing in the City of
    London, especially since the City churchyards have been converted into
    gardens. Of the old private gardens there are now left but few: one
    in St. Helen’s Place; one behind the Rectory of St. Andrew’s by the
    Wardrobe; the Drapers’ Gardens, much curtailed; and the churchyards
    above mentioned, which have been converted into gardens. In the
    sixteenth century, however, London was still full of gardens, in the
    north part of the City much more than in the south. Every house had
    its garden behind; for the most part narrow, yet carefully cultivated
    and full of trees and flowers. If you take the part of London that
    has been least meddled with, the north-west corner of the City, for
    instance—that part bounded by London Wall on the North; by Monkwell
    and Noble Streets on the West; by Gresham Street on the South; and by
    Moorgate on the East—you will find that the blocks between the older
    streets are intersected everywhere by courts, alleys, narrow lanes and
    buildings. These were all, including the ancient churches, taken out
    of the gardens. Formerly, for instance, between Basinghall Street and
    Coleman Street there were very long gardens behind the houses; these
    have been used for lanes of connection, and for workmen’s houses, such
    as Lilypot Lane and Oat Lane. Hidden away behind the houses is Sadler’s
    Hall; here also, hidden away behind houses, is Haberdashers’ Hall; here
    were the courtyards of inns, which formed among the gardens convenient
    ground for their great open courts and their stables. In this way the
    gardens of London gradually disappeared. In the sixteenth century,
    however, there were a great many still left: London presented an
    appearance of greenery and waving branches wherever one turned off the
    main roads. The chief authority on the gardens of the time is Harrison,
    who tells us what herbs, fruits, and roots were then grown, as well as
    the medicinal plants then so much cultivated.</p>

  <p>Harrison<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says, speaking of the flower gardens:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“If you look into our gardens annexed to our houses, how
      wonderfullie is their beauty increased, not onelie with floures
      which Colmella calleth <i>Terrena sydera</i>, saying, ‘Pingit et in
      varios terrestria sydera flores,’ and varietie of curious and
      costlie workmanship, but also with rare and medicinable hearbes
      sought up in the land within these fortie yeares; so that in
      comparison of this present, the ancient gardens were but dunghills
      and laistowes to such as did possess them.</p>

    <p>And even as it fareth with our gardens so dooth it with our
      orchards, which were never furnished with so good fruit, nor with
      such varietie as at this present. For beside that we have most
      delicate apples, plummes, peares, walnuts, filberds, etc., and
      those of sundrie sorts, planted within fortie yeares passed, in
      comparison of which most of the old trees are nothing woorth; so
      have we no less store of strange fruit, as abricotes, almonds,
      peaches, figges, corne-trees in noblemen’s orchards. I have seen
      capers, orenges, and lemmons, and heard of wild olives growing
      here, beside other strange trees, brought from far, whose names I
      know not. So that England for these commodities was never better
      furnished, neither anie nation under their clime more plentifullie
      indued with these and other blessings from the most high God, who
      grant us grace withall to use the same to His honour and glorie!
      and not as instruments and provocations unto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> further excesse and
      vanitie, wherewith His displeasure may be kindled, least these
      His benefits doo turne unto thornes and briers unto us for our
      annoiance and punishment which He hath bestowed upon us for our
      consolation and comfort.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The London garden was not only a place of recreation in the summer;
    it also furnished flowers for the pretty custom of decorating the
    rooms and strewing the floors; the gardens furnished pot herbs for
    the kitchen and sweet herbs for the walls and floors; branches also
    of fragrant woods, such as fir and pine, were hung up on the walls. I
    know not if this is a common custom still maintained in America; but
    in Hawthorne’s house at Concord the rooms are still decorated and made
    fragrant with branches of pine such as the writer used in his lifetime.
    The floor of the great hall was strewn with rushes, brought chiefly
    from the upper reaches and low-lying grounds of the river. These rushes
    were of various kinds: some of them were grasses, such as that called
    mat-weed, of which beds were made as well as floors strewn.</p>

  <p>The chief authorities on the London garden are Bacon in his <i>Essays</i>,
    and Gerard in his <i>Herbal</i>. Francis Bacon wrote his essays in Gray’s
    Inn, whose garden he laid out and planted by request of the Benchers.
    His essay on the garden was written, as he says himself, for the
    climate of London.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air (where
      it comes and goes like the warbling of music) than in the hand,
      therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what
      be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air. Roses,
      damask and red, are fast flowers of their smells, so that you may
      walk by a whole row of them, and find nothing of their sweetness,
      yea, though it be in a morning’s dew. Bays likewise yield no
      smell as they grow, rosemary little, nor sweet marjoram. That
      which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air is
      the violet, especially the white double violet, which comes twice
      a year, about the middle of April and about Bartholomew-tide.
      Next to that is the musk-rose; then the strawberry leaves dying,
      which yield a most excellent cordial smell. Then the flower of the
      vines; it is a little dust like the dust of a bent, which grows
      upon the cluster in the first coming forth. Then sweetbriar, then
      wall-flowers, which are very delightful to be set under a parlour
      or lower chamber window. Then pinks and gilliflowers, especially
      the matted pink and clove gilliflowers. Then the flowers of the
      lime-tree. Then the honeysuckles, so they be somewhat afar off; of
      bean-flowers I speak not, because they are field-flowers. But those
      which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by as the rest,
      but being trodden upon and crushed, are three—that is, burnet,
      wild thyme, and water-mints. Therefore you are to set whole alleys
      of them, to have the pleasure when you walk or tread.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Ordish’s <i>Shakespeare’s London</i> will be found an excellent analysis
    of Gerard’s <i>Herbal</i> as it deals with the gardens of the City and its
    suburbs. In it also is an enumeration of the principal gardens of the
    time, especially those of the Inns of Court. To these may be added
    the gardens belonging to those of the City Companies whose Halls were
    in the north part of the City, and those not yet built over which had
    once formed part of the monastic precincts, not to speak of the private
    gardens which were in many cases—such as the house of Sir Thomas
    Gresham in Broad Street—large and spacious. (<i>See</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_VII">Appendix VII.</a>)</p>

  <p>The allusions to London and to City customs in Shakespeare are
    numerous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> but not, as a rule, instructive. That is to say, he speaks
    of streets and places which we know from other sources. The Tower,
    the Bridge, Smithfield, Fish Street, St. Magnus Corner, the Savoy,
    the Tower Royal (King Richard’s Palace), Westminster Hall, Eastcheap,
    Bankside, the Temple, Cheapside, London Stone, Baynard’s Castle,
    Blackfriars, Paris Garden, are mentioned with the familiarity of one
    who lived in the City and knew all the streets intimately. It is
    pleasant to find them playing their parts in the immortal plays, but,
    as I said above, they teach us nothing.</p>

  <p>In 1568, to escape the cruelties of Alva, a vast number of Flemings
    came across the sea and were received hospitably. In order to prevent
    their arrival proving an injury to the crafts of London, they were
    scattered about, finding homes in Norwich, Colchester, Maidstone,
    Sandwich, and Southampton, as well as in London. In the next generation
    they appear to have been completely merged in the English population,
    and the custom, common among persons of foreign descent, of anglicising
    their names has made it very difficult to discover the Flemish origin
    of a family. The earlier Flemish settlers in England were regarded with
    hatred. It would seem that another colony of Flemings came over before
    this immigration in the year 1568; they were settled in Suffolk. In
    1594 a good many Portuguese came over as retainers to Don Antonio, and
    settled here. Among them was the Balthazar who became confectioner to
    King James and founded almshouses at Tottenham. There were Italians,
    probably connected with the Italian trade, for the “Lombardi,” the
    Pope’s men, were gone; they had a service at the Mercers’ Chapel every
    Sunday. There were also a great many “Dutch,” among whom were numbered
    the Flemings. Thus, in 1567, a census was taken of “foreigners” in
    London. There were found to be 4851 altogether, of whom 3838 were
    Dutch, and 720 French. A few years later the French Ambassador reports
    that there were 13,700 strangers in London, of whom a third were going
    to be turned out.</p>

  <p>Of the hatred and suspicion entertained towards foreigners by Londoners
    we have many proofs. “They scoff and laugh at foreigners,” says the
    Duke of Wurtemberg, “and, moreover, one dares not oppose them, else
    the street boys and apprentices collect together in immense crowds and
    strike to the right and left unmercifully without regard to person.”
    Isaac Casaubon in James the First’s reign complained that he had never
    been so badly treated as by the people of London: they threw stones
    at his windows; they pelted his children and himself with stones. The
    Venetian Ambassador of 1497 testifies to the same effect; in 1557 his
    successor says that it is impossible to live in London on account of
    the insolence with which foreigners are treated.</p>

  <p>At the same time it must be remembered that there were quarters
    assigned to foreigners, and that the people must have been accustomed
    to see these residents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> going about the streets. Perhaps they were
    only insolent to foreign nobles, and those whose dress and language
    were not familiar to them. The Hanse merchants had their house beside
    Dowgate, Petty Almaigne; the Flemings had theirs on the east side of
    the Bridge, Petty Flanders: the French had a place in Bishopsgate Ward
    called Petty France. It was in Petty Flanders that certain Jews resided
    under the guise of Flemings, just as in the fourteenth century they
    passed themselves off as Lombards. The Flemings built the Exchange: it
    was designed after the Antwerp Bourse, by a Fleming; the workmen were
    specially brought over, and appear to have been unmolested.</p>

  <p>In February 1831 there was swept away, with all the buildings in the
    place called the King’s Mews, where Trafalgar Square now is, a small
    building called Queen Elizabeth’s Bath. It was a square building of
    fine brick. It was certainly a Bath, and had a groined roof ascribed by
    Mr. William Knight who sketched it to the fifteenth century. It was an
    interesting building of which nothing seems known. Nobody has noticed
    it except a writer in <i>Archæologia</i> (vol. xxv.), who gives a plan
    and drawing of the curious place. Like the Sanctuary at Westminster
    it would have been entirely forgotten but for the hand of a single
    antiquary, who rescued it from oblivion at the last moment.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1500 a change of some importance was effected by Sir John
    Shaw, Mayor of that year. Before his time the civic feasts had been
    held at the Hall of the Grocers or the Taylors. Sir John Shaw built
    kitchens and offices at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> Guildhall and began the custom of holding
    the Lord Mayor’s feast in that place.</p>

  <p>The election of Sheriffs was formerly conducted by the citizens, who,
    by the Charter of King Henry IV., could appoint Sheriffs from their
    own body “according to the tenor of the Charters granted by the King’s
    progenitors and not in any other way” (<i>Liber Albus</i>, p. 148), and
    in the first book of the same work the manner of the election of the
    Sheriff is described in greater detail (<i>Liber Albus</i>, 1861 edition, p.
    39):—</p>

  <p>“As concerning the election of Sheriffs,—the Mayor, Recorder,
    Aldermen, and Commons, are to be assembled on the day of Saint Matthew
    the Apostle [21 September], in such manner as is ordained on the
    election of the Mayor; and in the first place, the Mayor shall choose,
    of his own free will, a reputable man, free of the City, to be one of
    the Sheriffs for the ensuing year; for whom he is willing to answer as
    to one half of the ferm<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the City due to the King, if he who is
    so elected by the Mayor shall prove not sufficient. But if the Mayor
    elect him by counsel and with the assent of the Aldermen, they also
    ought to be answerable with him. And those who are elected for the
    Common Council, themselves, and the others summoned by the Mayor for
    this purpose, as before declared, shall choose another Sheriff, for the
    commonalty; for whom all the commonalty is bound to be answerable as to
    the other half of the ferm so due to the King, in case he shall prove
    not sufficient.”</p>

  <p>The custom is illustrated by the following story concerning the
    election of William Massam as Sheriff by Sir Edward Osborne, the
    Mayor:—</p>

  <p>“In this year, one day in the month of July, there were two great
    feasts at London, one at Grocers’ Hall, another at Haberdashers’ Hall
    (as perhaps there was in all the rest upon some public occasion). Sir
    Edward Osborne, Mayor, and divers of his brethren the Aldermen, with
    the Recorder, were at Haberdashers’ Hall, where the said Mayor, after
    the second course was come in, toke the great standing cup, the gift
    of Sir William Garret, being full of hypocrase; and silence being
    commanded through all the tables, all men being bare-headed, my Lord
    openly with a convenient loud voice, used these words:—‘Mr. Recorder
    of London, and you my good brethren the Aldermen, bear witness, that I
    do drink unto Mr. Alderman Massam, as Sheriff of London and Middlesex,
    from Michaelmas next coming, for one whole year; and I do beseech God
    to give him as quiet and peaceable a year, with as good and gracious
    favour of her Majesty, as I myself, and my brethren the Sheriffs now
    being, have hitherto had, and as I trust shall have.’ This spoken, all
    men desired the same.</p>

  <p>The Sword-bearer in haste went to the Grocers’ feast, where Mr.
    Alderman Massam was at dinner, and did openly declare the words that my
    Lord Mayor had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>used; whereunto silence made, and all being hush, the
    Alderman answered very modestly in this sort:—</p>

  <p>‘First, I thank God, who, through His great goodness, hath called me
    from a very poor and mean degree unto this worshipful state. Secondly,
    I thank her Majesty for her gracious goodness in allowing to us these
    great and ample franchises. And, thirdly, I thank my Lord Mayor for
    having so honourable an opinion of this my Company of Grocers, so as
    to make choice of me, being a poor Member of the same.’ And this said,
    both he and all the Company pledged my Lord, and gave him thanks.”</p>

  <p>The Lord Mayor’s Show in the sixteenth century, conducted partly on
    horseback, and partly by water, was a far finer pageant than any
    that our generation has been enabled to witness. The following is a
    contemporary account:—</p>

  <p>“The day of St. Simon and Jude, he (the Mayor) entrethe into his
    estate and offyce; and the next daie following he goeth by water to
    Westmynster in most tryumphlyke maner. His barge beinge garnished with
    the armes of the citie; and nere the sayd barge goeth a shyppbote of
    the Queenes Majestie, beinge trymed upp, and rigged lyke a shippe of
    warre, with dyvers peces of ordinance, standards, penons, and targetts
    of the proper armes of the sayd Mayor, the armes of the Citie, of his
    company; and of the merchaunts adventurers, or of the staple, or of
    the company of the newe trades; next before hym goeth the barge of
    the lyvery of his owne company, decked with their owne proper armes,
    then the bachelers’ barge, and soo all the companies in London, in
    order, every one havinge their owne proper barge garnished with the
    armes of their company. And so passinge alonge the Thamise, landeth at
    Westmynster, where he taketh his othe in Thexcheker, beffore the judge
    there (whiche is one of the chiefe judges of England), whiche done, he
    returneth by water as afforsayd, and landeth at powles wharfe, where
    he and the reste of the Aldermen take their horses, and in great pompe
    passe through the greate streete of the citie, called Cheapside. And
    fyrste of all cometh ij great estandarts, one havinge the armes of
    the citie, and the other the armes of the Mayor’s Company; next them
    ij drommes and a flute, then an ensigne of the citie, and then about
    IXX or IXXX poore men marchinge ij and two togeather in blewe gownes,
    with redd sleeves and capps, every one bearinge a pyke and a target,
    whereon is paynted the armes of all them that have byn Mayor of the
    same company that this newe mayor is of. Then ij banners, one of the
    kynges armes, the other of the Mayor’s owne proper armes. Then a sett
    of hautboits playinge, and after them certayne wyfflers, in velvett
    cotes, and chaynes of golde, with white staves in their handes, then
    the pageant of tryumphe rychly decked, whereuppon by certayne fygures
    and wrytinges, some matter touchinge justice, and the office of a
    maiestrate is represented. Then xvj trompeters, viij and viij in a
    company, havinge banners of the Mayor’s company. Then certayne wyfflers
    in velvet cotes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> and chaynes, with white staves as afordsayde. Then the
    bachelers ij and two together, in longe gownen, with crymson hoodes
    on their shoulders of sattyn; which bachelers are chosen every yeare
    of the same company that the Mayor is of (but not of the lyvery) and
    serve as gentlemen on that and other festivall daies, to wayte on the
    Mayor, beinge in nomber accordinge to the quantetie of the company,
    sometimes sixty or one hundred. After them xij trompeters more, with
    banners of the Mayor’s company, then the dromme and flute of the citie,
    and an ensigne of the Mayor’s company, and after, the waytes of the
    citie in blewe gownes, redd sleeves and cappes, every one havinge his

    gownes, every one havinge his hood on his lefte shoulder, halfe black
    and halfe redd, the nomber of them is accordinge to the greatnes of the
    companye whereof they are. After them followe Sheriffes officers, and
    then the Mayor’s officers, with other officers of the citie, as the
    comon sargent, and the chamberlayne; next before the Mayore goeth the
    sword-bearer, having on his headd the cappe of honor, and the sworde of
    the citie in his right hande, in a riche skabarde, sett with pearle,
    and on his left hand goeth the comon cryer of the citie, with his great
    mace on his shoulder, all gilt. The Mayor elect in a long gowne of
    skarlet, and on his lefte shoulder a hood of black velvet, and a riche
    coller of gold of SS. about his neck, and with him rydeth the olde
    Mayor also, in his skarlet gowne, hood of velvet, and a chayne of golde
    about his neck. Then all the Aldermen ij and ij together (amongst whom
    is the Recorder) all in skarlet gownes; and those that have byn Mayors,
    have chaynes of gold, the other have black velvett tippetts. The ij
    Shereffes come last of all, in their black skarlet fownes and chaynes
    of golde.</p>

  <p>In this order they passe alonge through the citie, to the Guyldhall,
    where they dyne that daie, to the number of 1000 persons, all at
    the charge of the Mayor and the ij Shereffes. This feast costeth
    £400, whereof the Mayor payeth £200 and eche of the Shereffes £100.
    Immediately after dyner, they go to the churche of St. Paule, every
    one of the aforesaid poore men bearrynge staffe torches and targetts,
    whiche torches are lighted when it is late, before they come from
    evenynge prayer.” (Drake, <i>Shakespeare and his Times</i>, vol. ii. p. 164.)</p>

  <p>The very pretty story of Edward Osborne and the rescue of his master’s
    daughter is narrated by Maitland as belonging to the year 1559, but the
    date does not matter.</p>

  <p>Sir William Hewitt, citizen and clothworker, Mayor in 1559, lived
    on London Bridge. He was himself the son of a country gentleman of
    Yorkshire; he had for apprentice one Edward Osborne, also son of a
    country gentleman, Richard Osborne, of Ashford, Kent. Hewitt had three
    sons and one daughter. It happened one day, the child being yet an
    infant, that the maid playing with her at the open window let her
    fall out of the window into the river below. The ’prentice Osborne,
    fortunately seeing the accident, boldly jumped into the river and
    saved the child. Years after, when the child was grown up, Hewitt, one
    of the richest of London merchants, refused to give her in marriage to
    the Earl of Shrewsbury and other noble suitors, but gave her to the man
    who had saved her life. Sir Edward Osborne, as he afterwards became,
    Mayor in 1583, was the ancestor of the Dukes of Leeds.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>Until recently it was customary for the Lord Mayor to go on Sundays in
    state to one or other of the City churches.</p>

  <p>On these occasions the Lord Mayor was accompanied by the sheriffs and
    officials of the Corporation, and escorted by the mace-bearer and
    sword-bearer, the latter wearing the cap of maintenance, and carrying
    the state sword. It was usual for the Alderman of the Ward to be
    present with any other alderman that pleased to come, and as many as
    came brought with them their ward beadles, carrying the ward maces.</p>

  <p>Towards the latter part of the sixteenth century the practice of
    carrying the sword into church before the Lord Mayor became customary.
    It is not clear when this practice first began, but after the Fire of
    London and the rebuilding of the City it became the universal custom,
    and so continued until a comparatively recent period, when the exodus
    of the citizens made it not only inconvenient but an absolute tax upon
    the officers of the Corporation if the Lord Mayor attended church in
    state with his sword borne before him.</p>

  <p>But for the time that it lasted, that is rather more than two
    centuries, it necessitated the introduction into the City churches
    of a convenient stand or case upon which the City sword was placed.
    The State visits of the Lord Mayor having been discontinued in
    the mayoralty of Sir Robert Fowler, the consequence is that the
    sword-stands have ceased to have any use. Those stands which had
    artistic merit will no doubt be preserved.</p>

  <p>It may be taken as certain that these sword-cases or stands were not
    in use before the reign of Queen Elizabeth. There were many schedules
    of ecclesiastical furniture in existence prior to that date, but in
    none of them is there any mention of such an article as a sword-case,
    or sheath, or stand, although the list of articles is most minute. The
    earliest mention is in the Account Books of St. Michael’s, Cornhill,
    published by Mr. Alfred I. Waterlow.</p>

  <p>Under date 1574, that is, in the sixteenth year of Queen Elizabeth’s
    reign, there is the following entry:—</p>

  <p>“Paid for guylding of the case for my Lord Mayor’s swearde ... 9s.”</p>

  <p>Hawes was a resident in the parish, and was Lord Mayor in the year
    1574–1575. He had had a new pew made for him just outside the chancel
    screen a year or two before, on his being appointed Alderman of
    Cornhill Ward, and the pew was further fitted with a gilded sword-case
    on his being made Lord Mayor.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Tudor period begins with the lowest point reached in town and
    country of a decline and decay that had been steadily persistent for
    nearly two hundred years. The prosperity of a trading city depends
    upon the prosperity of its markets. There were many causes for this decay.
    The famines, of which there were four, in the fourteenth and fifteenth
    centuries; the Hundred Years’ War; the Civil Wars; the weakness of
    the fleet and the piracies in the Channel; the growth of the power of
    Parliament and the consequent decay of local independence; the feeble
    government of Edward II. and Henry VI.; the fearful devastation of the
    Black Death; the changes in the manorial system;—all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> things
    together contributed to the decay of trade over the whole country. To
    quote a writer on the fifteenth century. Denton, in his <i>England in
      the Fifteenth Century</i>, says that the decay of England commenced soon
    after the death of Edward I. It continued, showing an increased rate of
    decay, after the death of Edward II.</p>

  <p>The country parishes everywhere, on the northern and the Welsh march,
    on the southern seaboard, and in the Eastern Counties, had to be
    exempted from payment of taxes on account of poverty; lands were
    untilled; there was loss of sheep and cattle; agriculture was at a
    standstill for fear of pirates. Or the country parishes were actually
    deserted: the people, ruined, had left the farms and the clearings; the
    churches were allowed to fall into ruin; Monastic Houses were desolate
    and empty because the Brethren had no longer any rents.</p>

  <p>In the towns there were open spaces within the walls where houses had
    once stood. One has only to visit King’s Lynn in Winchelsea for an
    example of this decay.</p>

  <p>Even in London, it has been observed, for more than a hundred years
    after the Rebellion of Jack Straw there stood in Fleet Street the
    blackened ruins of two forges which that rebel’s followers had burned.
    In all that time there was not found any who thought it worth while to
    rebuild the forge.</p>

  <p>In London during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, although the
    time was one of commercial decline, there were still rich merchants.
    It is in a time of decay that the merchants make complaints of aliens;
    that they clamour for protection; that they demand the import and
    the export of merchandise in English ships; that they would prohibit
    the sending of gold and silver out of the country; let the foreign
    merchants be paid in kind.</p>

  <p>The melancholy condition of the country at the beginning of the
    sixteenth century is described most vividly by Cunningham:—</p>

  <p>“There is less mention made of decay in the first thirty years of the
    sixteenth century; but the facts were again brought forcibly forward
    when the Parliament of Henry VIII. began to put pressure on the
    owners of houses to repair their property and to remove the rubbish
    that endangered life in the towns. Norwich had never recovered from
    the fire of 1508; the empty spaces at Lynn Bishop allowed the sea to
    do damage in other parts of the town. Many houses were ruined and
    the streets were dangerous for traffic in Nottingham, Shrewsbury,
    Ludlow, Bridgenorth, Queenborough, Northampton and Gloucester; there
    were vacant spaces heaped with filth, and tottering houses in York,
    Lincoln, Canterbury, Coventry, Bath, Chichester, Salisbury, Winchester,
    Bristol, Scarborough, Hereford, Colchester, Rochester, Portsmouth,
    Poole, Lyme, Feversham, Worcester, Stafford, Buckingham, Pontefract,
    Grantham, Exeter, Ipswich, Southampton, Great Yarmouth, Oxford, Great
    Wycombe, Guildford, Stratford, Hull, Newcastle, Bedford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> Leicester
    and Berwick; as well as in Shaston, Sherborne, Bridport, Dorchester,
    Weymouth, Plymouth, Barnstaple, Tavistock, Dartmouth, Launceston,
    Lostwithiel, Liskeard, Bodmin, Truro, Helston, Bridgewater, Taunton,
    Somerton, Ilchester, Maldon and Warwick. There were similar dangers to
    the inhabitants of Great Grimsby, Cambridge, the Cinque Ports, Lewes;
    and even in the more remote provinces things were as bad, for Chester,
    Tenby, Haverfordwest, Pembroke, Caermarthen, Montgomery, Cardiff,
    Swansea, Cowbridge, New Radnor, Presteign, Brecknock, Abergavenny,
    Usk, Caerlon, Newport in Monmouthshire, Lancaster, Preston, Liverpool
    and Wigan, were taken in hand in 1544. In trying to interpret this
    evidence, however, we must remember that we are reading of attempts
    to repair, not of complaints of new decline; the mere fact that such
    attempts were made was perhaps an indication that things had reached
    their worst; and we are perhaps justified in inferring from the double
    mention of some few towns that a real improvement was effected in the
    others.” (<i>The Growth of English Industry.</i>)</p>

  <p>There is thus abundant evidence concerning the decay of trade.
    Cunningham speaks of the decay of the craft gilds and their
    mismanagement. This may be considered a part of the general decay and
    a consequence. At first, the craft gilds exercised police control over
    their members and so secured good order; the old authority and power
    of the alderman in his ward had been practically taken over by the
    gilds; each master had his apprentices living with him and forming part
    of his own household. Yet the apprentices made the riot in 1517 long
    remembered as Evil May Day. Another of their objects was the production
    of honest and good work. Yet in 1437 and again in 1503 it was enacted
    that no ruler of gilds or fraternities should make any ordinances which
    were not approved by the Chancellor of the Justices of Assize. The
    third object was the securing of fair conditions for those who worked
    in the trade. Yet consider the grievances of the journeymen in 1536:—</p>

  <p>“Previous Acts relating to craft abuses are recited and the statute
    proceeds: ‘Sithen which several acts established and made, divers
    masters, wardens and fellowships of crafts, have by cautel and subtle
    means practised and compassed to defraud and delude the said good and
    wholesome statutes, causing divers apprentices or young men immediately
    after their years be expired, or that they be made free of their
    occupation or fellowship, to be sworn upon their holy Evangelist at
    their first entry, that they nor any of them after their years or term
    expired shall not set up, nor open any shop, house, nor cellar, nor
    occupy as freeman without the assent and license of the master, wardens
    or fellowship of their occupations, upon pain of forfeiting their
    freedom or other like penalty; by reason whereof the said ’prentices
    and journeymen be put to as much or more charges thereby than they
    beforetime were put unto for the obtaining and entering of their
    freedom, to the great hurt and impoverishment of the said ’prentices
    and journeymen and other their friends.’ Such restrictions naturally
    resulted in the withdrawal of the journeymen to set up shops in suburbs
    or villages where the gild had no jurisdiction; and from this they were
    not precluded, in all probability, by the terms of their oath. This
    might often be their only chance of getting employment, as the masters
    were apparently inclined to overstock their shops with apprentices,
    rather than be at the expense of retaining a full proportion of
    journeymen.” (<i>The Growth of English Industry.</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>In 1545 Henry VIII. ordained the confiscation of the property of all
    colleges, fraternities, brotherhoods and gilds. This measure, sweeping
    in its terms, was not generally carried out. In 1547 the advisers
    of Edward VI. swept away all the craft gilds in England except the
    Companies of London and a few gilds in country towns. The statute
    provided that artisans might work where they pleased whether they were
    free of the town or not.</p>

  <p>Trade, therefore, had entered upon new conditions; this was inevitable,
    owing to the many changes—the revolutionary changes which created so
    wide a gulf between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries.</p>

  <p>With these preliminaries we can now proceed to the revival and
    expansion of trade and the development of enterprise in the sixteenth
    century, but more especially during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The endowment of the City with a Bourse is generally attributed to
    the perception by Sir Thomas Gresham of the need for such a place
    of meeting,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> though the matter had been mooted and the opinion of
    merchants taken thirty years before.</p>

  <p>In the year 1537, Sir Richard Gresham, the father of Sir Thomas
    Gresham, whose business had taken him to Antwerp, when he saw the
    Bourse frequented daily by merchants, wrote a letter to Cromwell in
    which he suggested the erection of a Bourse in Lombard Street, as the
    place most frequented by merchants. As nothing came of the proposal
    he wrote again in the following year with an estimate of the cost,
    viz. £2000. If, he said, the Lord Privy Seal would induce Alderman Sir
    George Monoux to part with certain property at cost price he, Gresham,
    would undertake to raise £1000 towards the building before he went out
    of office. Whereupon the King addressed a letter to Monoux desiring
    him to dispose of certain property in Lombard Street, which was wanted
    for the commonweal of the merchants. Monoux, with Gresham’s consent,
    referred the matter to arbitration. A yearly sum of twenty marks to be
    paid by the City was offered. Monoux at first refused to take it, but
    afterwards, at the King’s request, consented. Then, for some unknown
    reason, nothing more was done. The matter was left over for many years.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

  <p>At this time Thomas Gresham (son of Sir Richard by his first wife,
    Audrey, daughter of William Lynne of Southwick, Northampton) was
    nineteen years of age, and still serving his apprenticeship to his
    uncle, Sir John Gresham, Mercer. He was received into the Company in
    1543. In the same year he was acting for the King at Antwerp. In 1551
    he was appointed Royal Agent or King’s merchant, which caused him to
    reside at Antwerp during many months, and at frequent intervals. On
    the accession of Mary he was dismissed, but his services were speedily
    discovered to be necessary, and he was reappointed. Elizabeth continued
    his appointment.</p>

  <p>In 1561 his factor, Richard Clough, wrote to him from Antwerp
    expressing his astonishment that London should have gone on so long
    without a Bourse:—</p>

  <p>“Considering what a City London is; and that in so many years the same
    found not the means to make a Burse, but merchants must be contented
    to stand and walk in the rain, more like pedlars than Merchants. In
    this Country, said he (meaning Antwerp), and in all other, there is
    no kind of people that have occasion to meet but ye have a place for
    that purpose; indeed and if your business were done (here) and that I
    might have the leisure to go about it, and that I would be a means to
    Mr. Secretary to have his favour therein, I would not doubt but to make
    so fair a burse in London as the great burse is in Antwerp, without
    soliciting of any Man more than he shall be well disposed to give.”</p>

  <p>Gresham remembered the attempt made by his father in 1538 and its
    failure; he resolved to take up the matter again, and in some way
    introduced it to the Court of Aldermen, who asked him, through one of
    their body, what he proposed to give himself towards the undertaking.
    This was in 1563, two years after Clough wrote his letter. Gresham took
    time to consider. In 1565 he sent in the offer. He would himself erect
    a “comely burse” if the City would provide a suitable site.</p>

  <p>The site was found on the north side of Cornhill. Two alleys, Swan
    Alley and New St. Christopher’s, were purchased for £3532: the
    materials of the houses sold for £478. Subscriptions were invited and
    came in readily. On the 7th of June 1566 Sir Thomas was able to lay the
    foundation stone. Every one of the aldermen laid his stone or brick,
    with a piece of gold for the workmen.</p>

  <p>The architect and the design came from Flanders. The Clerk of the Work,
    Henryk, was a Fleming, and most of the workmen were foreigners, special
    permission being granted for their employment. The City gave 100,000
    bricks; the stone-work came from abroad, and “to this day” (Sharpe)
    “the Royal Exchange is paved with small blocks of Turkish hone-stones,
    believed to have been imported by Sir Thomas Gresham and to have been
    relaid after the fires of 1666 and 1838.”</p>

  <p>Observe, therefore, that to the City belonged the site, but that the
    Exchange itself was the property of Gresham.</p>

  <p>By the 22nd of December 1568 the Burse was so far complete as to
    allow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> merchants meeting within its walls; but it was not till the
    23rd of January 1571 that the Queen herself visited it in state, and
    gave it the name of the Royal Exchange. From the beginning a part of
    the Exchange was set aside for Marine Insurance, not a new thing,
    because it had long been the practice of the Lombard merchants in the
    thirteenth century to give such insurances.</p>

  <p>The Royal Exchange became a place of recreation as well as of business.
    The citizens walked here on the evenings of Sundays and Holy days,
    where the City waits played from 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> till 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
    up to the Feast of Pentecost, then they played from 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
    till 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> until Michaelmas. In 1576 it was ordered that no
    games of football should be played within the Royal Exchange.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Exchange remained the property of Sir Thomas Gresham until his
    death, when he bequeathed the building together with his mansion in
    Broad Street, after the death of his wife, on certain conditions, to
    the City and the Mercers’ Company in trust, viz.:—</p>

  <p>“The Citizens, for their Moiety of the said Edifice, are from Time
    to Time to appoint four Persons duly qualified to read Lectures of
    Divinity, Astronomy, Musick, and Geometry, in his Mansion-house
    [afterwards Gresham College], and to pay annually to each of the said
    Lecturers a Salary or Stipend of fifty Pounds. And also to pay yearly
    to his eight Alms-People in <i>Broad-Street</i> (whom the Mayor and Citizens
    have likewise the Power of chusing) the sum of six Pounds thirteen
    Shillings and four Pence each. And besides, to pay annually to the
    Prisons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> of <i>Newgate</i>, <i>Ludgate</i>, <i>Kings-Bench</i>, <i>Marshalsey</i>, and
    <i>Wood-Street Compter</i>, the Sum of ten Pounds each.</p>

  <p>And the Mercers, for their Half, are, from Time to Time, to chuse
    three persons well accomplished, to read Lectures of Law, Physick, and
    Rhetorick, in the aforesaid Mansion-House called <i>Gresham-College</i>,
    with the same salaries to each of the Lecturers as to the
    above-mentioned. The said Company of Mercers are likewise obliged
    to pay the sum of one hundred Pounds per Ann. for four quarterly
    Dinners to be provided at their Hall, for the Entertainment of the
    whole Company; and also to pay to <i>Christ’s</i>, <i>St. Bartholomews</i>, the
    <i>Spital</i>, <i>Bethlehem</i>, and <i>St. Thomas’s</i> Hospitals, and the <i>Poultry
      Compter</i>, the Sum of ten Pounds per Ann. each.” (Maitland, vol. i. pp.
    256–257.)</p>

  <p>The reversion fell in on the death of Lady Gresham in 1596, when the
    City and the Company took steps to carry out the Trust. Gresham House
    became Gresham College, and so continued until the year 1767, when the
    Crown took over the building for an Excise office, giving the City £500
    a year perpetual annuity. For some time the lectures ceased; when they
    were renewed they were delivered in the City of London School until the
    building of the present Gresham College in Basinghall Street.</p>

  <p>We have become accustomed to consider the enterprise and restless
    spirit of adventure which makes the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
    so full of interest, as finding their sole field in the New World
    and in voyages such as those of Drake and Cavendish; and in heroes
    such as Frobisher, Gilbert, and Raleigh. We forget the expeditions of
    Willoughby and Burroughs to find a north-east passage; the courage of
    Chancellor, who opened up trade with Russia; the travels of Jenkinson,
    who first crossed Russia and sailed over the Caspian Sea; the brave
    Captains of the Levant Company, who fought their way through the
    Barbary corsairs and the galleys of Spain; those faithful servants
    of the same Company, Newbery, Fitch, and Leedes, who discovered the
    long-forgotten overland route to India; the voyages of the first ships
    of the East India Company in seas unknown, among a people strange and
    suspicious; the persistent attempts to open up the African trade; we
    have forgotten—if we ever learned—how, all over the world, along the
    shores of the Baltic, in Arctic seas, round the Cape of Good Hope, in
    the Far East, in North-West America and in the West Indies, the sails
    of England carried the gallant adventurers whose very numbers make
    their names difficult to be remembered; across the unknown plains of
    Russia, across the Great Syrian desert, unvisited by Christians since
    the days of Bohemond and Baldwin, down the Great River, even the river
    Euphrates; in the Courts of the Great Mogul, in Malay land, among the
    Red Indians of North America,—everywhere, visible to all, were found
    the men of the Western Queen, as great a name to the Czar of Muscovy as
    to Philip of Spain.</p>

  <p>In Hakluyt may be found written by Anthony Jenkinson, one of the most
    determined and most daring of the trading travellers of this time,
    a list of the countries which he had visited in six years. It is as
    follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The names of such countries as I Anthony Jenkinson have travelled
      unto, from the second of October 1546, at which time I made my
      first voyage out of England, untill the yeere of our Lord 1572,
      when I returned last out of Russia.</p>

    <p>First, I passed into Flanders, and travelled through all the base
      countries, and from thence from Germanie, passing over the Alpes
      I travelled into Italy, and from thence made my journey through
      Piemont into France, throughout all which realme I have thoroughly
      journied.</p>

    <p>I have also travelled through the kingdomes of Spaine and
      Portingal, I have sailed through the Levant seas every way, and
      have bene in all the chiefe Islands within the same sea, as Rhodes,
      Malta, Sicilia, Cyprus, Candie, and divers others.</p>

    <p>I have bene in many partes of Grecia, Morea, Achaia, and where the
      olde citie of Corinth stoode.</p>

    <p>I have travelled through a great part of Turkie, Syria, and divers
      other countries in Asia minor.</p>

    <p>I have passed over the mountaines of Libanus to Damasco, and
      travelled through Samaria, Galile, Philistine or Palestine, unto
      Jerusalem and so through all the Holy land.</p>

    <p>I have been in divers places of Affrica, as Algiers, Col, Bon,
      Tripolis, the gollet within the Gulf of Tunis.</p>

    <p>I have sailed farre Northward within the Mare glaciale, where
      we have had continuall day; and sight of the Sunne ten weekes
      together, and that navigation was in Norway, Lapland, Samogitia;
      and other very strange places.</p>

    <p>I have travelled through all the ample dominions of the Emperour
      of Russia and Moscovis, which extende from the North sea, and the
      confines of Norway and Lapland, even to the Mare Caspium.</p>

    <p>I have bene in divers countries neere about the Caspian sea,
      Gentiles, and Mahometans, as Cazan, Cremia, Rezan, Cheremisi,
      Mordouiti, Vachin, Nagaia, with divers others of strange customs
      and religions.</p>

    <p>I have sailed over the Caspian Sea, and discovered all the regions
      thereabout adjacent, as Chircassi, Comul, Shascal, Shiruan, with
      many others.</p>

    <p>I have travelled 40 daies journey beyond the said sea, towards
      the Oriental India and Cathaia, through divers deserts and
      wildernesses, and passed through 5 kingdomes of the Tartars, and
      all the land of Turkeman and Zagatay, and so to the great city of
      Boghar in Bactria, not without great perils and dangers sundry
      times.</p>

    <p>After all this, in An. 1562 I passed againe over the Caspian sea
      another way, and landed in Armenia, at a citie called Derbent,
      built by Alexander the Great, and from thence travelled through
      Media, Parthia, Hircania, into Persia to the court of the great
      Sophie, called Shaw Tomasso, unto whom I delivered letters from the
      Queenes Majestie, and remained in his court 8 months, and returning
      homeward, passed through divers other countries. Finally, I made
      two voyages more after that out of England into Russia, the one in
      the yeere 1566, and the other in the yeere 1571. And thus being
      weary and growing old, I am content to take my seat in mine owne
      house, chiefly comforting myselfe, in that my service hath bene
      honourably accepted and rewarded of her majestie and the rest by
      whom I have beene employed.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And now it was that stories of danger from frost and from storm; of
    cruelties endured at the hands of savages, and pirates; of captivity
    among Moors; of tortures inflicted by the accursed Inquisition; of
    hairbreadth escapes; of wanderings over lands never before seen; of
    great treasures lying ready for the bold adventurer,—ran up and down
    the City. The ’prentice told what he had heard to fellow ’prentice; the
    sailors told the boys upon the wharves; the ship after her successful
    voyage came up to the Pool with cloth of gold for sails and dressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
    with flying streamers. Above all, the imagination of the youth was
    fired more by the splendid stones of danger and of battle and of escape
    from captivity than by the prospect of great riches. Do you know how
    John Fox escaped from Alexandria? For my own part I do not know any
    story better told or more certain to inspire the lads who heard it with
    a burning desire to be with such a company and to be doing such things.
    It is from Hakluyt (ii. 133), and I venture to relate it here and in
    his own words, to show the kind of story which quickened the pulse and
    fired the blood of the London youth.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Nowe these eight being armed with such weapons as they thought
      well of, thinking themselves sufficient champions to encounter
      a stronger enemie, and comming unto the prison, Fox opened the
      gates and doores thereof, and called forth all the prisoners, whom
      he set, some to ramming up the gate, some to the dressing up of
      a certaine gallie, which was the best in all the roade, and was
      called the captaine of Alexandria, whereinto some carried mastes,
      sailes, oares, and other such furniture as doth belong unto a
      gallie.</p>

    <p>At the prison were certaine warders, whom John Fox and his
      companie slew; in the killing of whom, there were eight more of
      the Turks, which perceived them, and got them to the toppe of the
      prison; unto whom John Fox, and his company, were faine to come by
      ladders, where they found a hot skirmish. For some of them were
      there slaine, some wounded, and some but scarred, and not hurt.
      As John Fox was thrise shot through his appareil, and not hurt,
      Peter Unticaro, and the other two, that had armed them with the
      duckats, were slaine, as not able to weild themselves, being so
      pestered with the weight and uneasie carying of the wicked and
      prophane treasure; and also divers Christians were as well hurt
      about that skirmish as Turkes slaine. Amongst the Turkes was one
      thrust thorowe, who (let us not say that it was ill fortune) fell
      off from the toppe of the prison wall, and made such a lowing, that
      the inhabitants thereabout (as here and there scattering stoode a
      house or two) came and dawed him, so that they understood the case,
      how that the prisoners were paying their ransomes; wherewith they
      raised both Alexandria which lay on the west side of the roade, and
      a Castle which was at the Cities end, next to the roade, and also
      an other Fortresse which lay on the north side of the roade; so
      that nowe they had no way to escape, but one, which by man’s reason
      (the two holdes lying so upon the mouth of the roade) might seeme
      impossible to be a way for them. So was the read sea impossible
      for the Israelites to passe through, the hils and rockes lay so
      on the one side, and their enemies compassed them on the other.
      So was it impossible that the wals of Jericho should fall downe,
      being neither undermined, nor yet rammed at with engines, nor yet
      any man’s wisdome, pollicie, or helpe set or put thereunto. Such
      impossibilities can our God make possible. He that helde the Lyons
      jawes from rending Daniel asunder, yea, or yet from once touching
      him to his hurt; can not He hold the roring canons of this hellish
      force? He that kept the fiers rage in the hot burning oven, from
      the three children, that praised His name, can not He keepe the
      fiers flaming blastes from among His elect?</p>

    <p>Now is the roade fraught with lustie souldiers, laborers, and
      mariners, who are faine to stand to their tackling, in setting
      to every man his hand, some to the carying in of victuals, some
      munitions, some oares, and some one thing, some another, but most
      are keeping their enemie from the wall of the road. But to be
      short, there was no time mispent, no man idle, nor any man’s labour
      ill bestowed, or in vaine. So that in short time, this gally was
      ready trimmed up. Whereinto every man leaped in all haste, hoyssing
      up the sayles lustily, yeelding themselves to His mercie and grace,
      in whose hands are both winde and weather.</p>

    <p>Now is this gally on flote, and out of the safetie of the roade;
      now have the two Castles full power upon the gally, now is there
      no remedy but to sinke; how can it be avoided? the Canons let flie
      from both sides, and the gally is even in the middest, and betweene
      them both. What man can devise to save it? there is no man, but
      would thinke it must needs be sunke.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

    <p>There was not one of them that feared the shotts, which went
      thundring round about their eares, nor yet were once scarred or
      touched, with five and forty shot, which came from the Castles.
      Here did God hold foorth His buckler, He shieldeth now this gally,
      and hath tried their faith to the uttermost. Now commeth His
      speciall helpe; yea, even when man thinks them past all helpe, then
      commeth He Himselfe downe from heaven with His mightie power, then
      is His present remedie most readie prest. For they saile away,
      being not once touched with the glaunce of a shot, and are quickly
      out of the Turkish canons reach. Then might they see them comming
      downe by heapes to the water side, in companies like unto swarmes
      of bees, making shew to come after them with gallies, in bustling
      themselves to dresse up the gallies, which would be a swift peece
      of worke for them to doe, for that they had neither oares, mastes,
      sailes, gables, nor anything else ready in any gally. But yet they
      are carying them unto them, some into one gally, and some into
      another, so that, being such a confusion amongst them, without any
      certaine guide, it were a thing impossible to overtake them; beside
      that, there was no man that would take charge of a gally, the
      weather was so rough, and there was such an amasedness [amazedness]
      amongst them.”</p>

    <div class="caption">SIR FRANCIS DRAKE (1540(?)–1596)<br />
      From an engraving by Elstracke in the British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The effect on London of the magnificent expeditions of the English was
    startling. Think what these things meant. The country for a long time
    could look back upon nothing but defeat, humiliation, civil war, and
    religious dissensions. There were no military achievements, no naval
    victories; no increase of trade;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> never was the nation more depressed
    and humbled than at the death of Queen Mary and the accession of
    Elizabeth.</p>

    <div class="caption">DRAKE’S “GOLDEN HIND,” IN WHICH HE SAILED ROUND THE
        WORLD, 1577–1580</div>
  </div>

  <p>Then—almost suddenly—all was changed. More than the old spirit came
    back to the Londoners, the descendants of the men who had followed
    Philpot the Mayor to the destruction of the Scottish pirate. Not only
    the sea dogs of Devon, but those of Wapping, Ratcliffe, Redriff, and
    the Cinque Ports went forth to fight the Spaniard wherever they could
    find him. Think of the career of Frobisher. Three times he essayed
    the north-west passage to Cathay; he commanded one of Drake’s ships
    in his expedition to the West Indies; he fought against the Armada;
    he was wounded, and died from wounds received at the siege of Crozan
    in Brittany. Forty years on the sea, sword in hand, sailed this brave
    captain. London possesses his body, which lies in St. Giles’s Church,
    Cripplegate. There was also Cavendish, the gentleman filibuster, who
    captured the richest prize ever known, and came home, his sails of
    damask, his sailors clad in silk, and his masts gleaming with cloth
    of gold. Or there was the defeat, the flight after battle against
    overwhelming odds, which affected the imagination even more than
    victory. Such was Sir John Hawkins’s fight at San Juan de Ulloa, five
    ships against thirteen. Even death, when death came splendidly, moved
    the hearts of the young men to brave deeds. Was there ever death finer
    than that of Sir Humphrey Gilbert? The last time he was seen by the
    people on the other ship, his companion, he was sitting on the high
    poop, his Bible in his hand. “We are as near to Heaven,” said the old
    captain, “by sea as by land.” Night fell and the men on the <i>Hind</i>
    saw the light of the <i>Squirrel</i> suddenly disappear. She had gone down
    with all on board. And while speaking of splendid deaths, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
    that of Sir Richard Grenville. In his ship the <i>Revenge</i>, with five
    other vessels, he was met by a Spanish fleet of fifty-three ships; his
    companions fled, and the <i>Revenge</i> alone fought them all:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“And the sun went down, and the stars came out, far over the summer sea,</div>
        <div class="i1">But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.</div>
        <div class="i1">Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,</div>
        <div class="i1">Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame:</div>

        <div class="i1">God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">But at length he was captured with his crippled ship and his diminished crew.</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:</div>

        <div class="i1">And he fell upon their decks, and he died.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The ship in which Drake sailed round the world (<i>The Golden Hind</i>),
    when it became unfit for service, was laid up near the “Mast Dock” at
    Deptford, where it remained for a long series of years an object of
    curiosity and wonder. Hentzner, in 1598, says he saw here the ship of
    that noble pirate, Francis Drake. From a passage in one of Ben Jonson’s
    plays it appears to have become a resort for holiday people, the cabin
    being then converted into a banqueting house. Drake’s ship at Deptford
    is spoken of as one of the “sights” in some verses prefixed to the
    redoubtable Tom Coryat’s <i>Crudities</i>, 1611. When the young Duke of
    Saxe-Weimar saw the ship in 1613, but very little remained of it. It
    was then lying by the river-side in shallow water, in a dock; the lower
    part only was left, the upper part being all gone, for almost everybody
    who went there, and especially sailors, were in the habit of carrying
    off some portion of it. Philipott, <i>History of Kent</i>, 1659, says
    that in a very short time nothing was left of her. And in Moryson’s
    <i>Itinerary</i>, 1617, it is noticed as follows—“Not farre from hence
    (Deptford), upon the shore, lie the broken ribs of the ship in which
    Sir Francis Drake sailed round the world, reserved for a monument of
    that great action.” A chair, made out of the wood, is to be seen in the
    gallery of the Bodleian Library at Oxford.</p>

  <p>Let us take a contemporary poet, to see how Drake’s own generation was
    affected by his exploits:—</p>

  <p>But enough of songs, we must return to the more serious aspects of
    Trading England. When merchants first began to carry on foreign trade
    in association it is impossible to ascertain. But as we find “Men
    of the Emperor” and “Men of Rouen” in London in Saxon times, it is
    probable that foreign trade was from the beginning carried on by
    members of companies. These members traded each for himself; but they
    were associated for protection, and of necessity an “interloper”—as
    the private trader was afterwards called—could not carry his wares
    to a foreign city when he knew not the language, or the customs, nor
    could claim the privileges accorded to the Companies. On the other
    hand, behind the members stood a powerful corporation; this gave the
    merchants credit; this procured for them respect and protection;
    this provided the machinery of warehouses, markets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> interpreters,
    and information as to laws, regulations, prices, demand, supply,
    privileges, and all the special points required to be mastered if trade
    were to be successful.</p>

  <p>The first foreign trading Company, then, was exactly like a Trades
    Guild, in which only members could follow the trade, which had its own
    quarter, made its own laws for itself, elected its own officers, yet
    every member worked for himself.</p>

  <p>The longest lived and the most important of the mediæval companies was
    the Hanseatic League, already mentioned at <a href="#Page_82">p. 82.</a></p>

    <div class="caption">A MERCHANT OF THE STEELYARD<br />
      From the portrait by Holbein at Windsor Castle.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The earliest association of London merchants for foreign trade is that
    called the Staplers’ Company. They claimed to have existed long before
    the Merchant Adventurers. There is, however, a great deal of mystery
    attached to their early history. Thus, if they were associated for
    exporting the staple wares, such as wool, lead, tin, and skins, how
    far did they overlap the Hanseatics? And were they all foreigners? The
    latter question seems answered by the law of 1253, which prohibited
    English merchants from exporting staple goods. Again, was this law
    strictly enforced? In 1362, more than a hundred years later, it was
    repealed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

  <p>The Merchants of the Staple are sometimes confused with the Fraternity
    of St. Thomas à Becket, from whom sprung a much more important
    body—the Merchant Adventurers. The reason of the decay of the Staplers
    was the growth of English industries, which forbade the exports of the
    most important of the staples—wool. The Staplers, however, continued
    their trade, having their headquarters at Antwerp, Brussels, Louvain,
    Calais, and Bruges, successively. It will be remembered that Edward
    III. established the Staple of Wool at Westminster; the name of Staple
    Inn preserved the fact that the merchants had houses on that site.</p>

  <p>About the year 1358 the Fraternity of Thomas Becket received privileges
    from Louis, Count of Flanders, for fixing their staple of English
    woollen cloth at Bruges. This Fraternity gave rise to the Mercers’
    Company founded under Edward the Third. The Saint, son of a London
    mercer, was especially regarded as the protector of the Company. The
    Brotherhood was not at first possessed of exclusive rights, but if
    we suppose that they were backed by the richest traders in London,
    namely, the Mercers and the Drapers, and that no other London trader
    would compete with them, it is quite probable that they feared no
    competition. They got a Charter in 1406 when Henry the Fourth gave them
    the right of choosing their own governors; they then began to arrogate
    to themselves exclusive rights, which were confirmed by another
    Charter of 1436. So wealthy and powerful did they become that when,
    in 1444, they removed their headquarters from Middleburg to Antwerp,
    the magistrates and citizens met them outside the town, and offered
    them an entertainment. Their Secretary, John Wheeler (<i>Treatise of
      Commerce</i>, 1601), says that the “English Nation” were the real founders
    of Antwerp’s wealth. There were troubles as to the attempts of private
    merchants to trade; in 1497 it was provided by Act of Parliament that
    every Englishman should have free entrance to foreign marts on payment
    of ten marks, presumably to the Fraternity. Again, in 1505, a new
    Charter changed their name to that of the “Merchant Adventurers of
    England.” Under this Charter they held in their hands the export trade
    in woollen cloths, and were authorised to hold courts and to admit
    other merchants for a fee of ten marks to trade with them in Flanders,
    Holland, Brabant, Zeeland, and the countries adjacent under the
    Archduke’s government. The Merchant Adventurers became a power in the
    land; so great a power, indeed, that when Charles the Fifth proposed to
    establish the Inquisition in Antwerp, he was dissuaded by the Merchant
    Adventurers, who threatened to leave the City if he persisted. It is
    said that the Company then employed 50,000 persons in the Netherlands.
    At this time their limits comprised all the ports from the river Somme
    to the German ports within the Baltic. They exported white and coloured
    cloths to the value of one million sterling every year, and imported,
    among other things, wine, copper, steel, gunpowder (could we not make
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>our own gunpowder?), silk, velvets, cloth of gold. This business was
    well nigh ruined by King James the First when he granted a monopoly for
    the sale of cloths dyed at home to Sir William Cockaine, Alderman. (See
    <i>London in the Time of the Stuarts</i>, p. 194.)</p>

    <div class="caption">MEDALS STRUCK IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMADA<br />
      From medals in the British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>As the Merchant Adventurers grew richer it became necessary, according
    to the bad practice of the time, to bribe statesmen for a continuance
    of their privileges; they also increased the fees for admission. The
    troubles between Holland and England in the seventeenth century drove
    the Adventurers to Hamburg, where they remained, and were called the
    Hamburg Company.</p>

  <p>The vast enlargement of trade and enterprise under Elizabeth was well
    begun under her father. In 1511 ships began to sail from the ports of
    London, Southampton, and Bristol to Sicily, Candia, Chio, Cyprus, and
    Tripoli; they took out woollen cloths and hides, and they brought back
    rhubarb, silk, corselets, malmsey, oil, cotton, carpets, and spices.
    An English merchant was appointed Consul at Candia; another merchant,
    a foreigner, was made Consul at Chio; in the year 1535 a ship took out
    from London a hundred persons who were settled by the English merchants
    as factors at the various centres of trade. Trade openings were made on
    the Coast of Guinea and with Morocco; ships sailed to Newfoundland and
    to Brazil. In the year 1583 was formed the first of the new Companies
    for trading purposes. This Company had an interesting but a disastrous
    beginning. It was started with a capital of £6000 in 240 shares of £25
    each; its original idea was to find a north-east passage to China and
    to open trade with the Chinese. Three vessels were fitted out under the
    command of Sir Hugh Willoughby. Would you know how the fleet started?
    Hakluyt tells the story:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It was thought best by the opinion of them all, that by the
      twentieth of May, the Captaines and Mariners should take shipping,
      and depart from Radcliffe, upon the ebbe, if it pleased God.
      They having saluted their acquiaintance, one his wife, another
      his children, another his kinsfolkes, and another his friends
      deerer then his kinsfolkes, were present and ready at the day
      appoynted; and having wayed ancre, they departed with the turning
      of the water, and sailing easily, came first to Greenewich. The
      greater shippes are towed downe with boates, and oares, and the
      mariners being all apparelled in Watchet or skie coloured cloth,
      rowed amaine, and made way with diligence. And being come neere
      to Greenewich (where the Court then lay) presently upon the newes
      thereof, the Courtiers came running out, and the common people
      flockt together, standing very thicke upon the shoare; the privie
      Counsel, they lookt out at the windowes of the Court, and the
      rest ranne up to the toppes of the towers; the shippes hereupon
      discharge their Ordinance, and shot off their pieces after the
      maner of warre, and of the sea, insomuch that the tops of the
      hilles sounded therewith, the valleys and waters gave an echo, and
      the Mariners they shouted in such sort, that the skie rang againe
      with the noyse thereof. One stoode in the poope of the ship, and
      by his gestures bid farewell to his friends in the best maner
      hee could. Another walkes upon the hatches, another climbes the
      shrowds, another stands upon the maine yard, and another in the top
      of the shippe. To be short, it was a very triumph (after a sort)
      in all respects to the beholders. But (alas) the good King Edward
      (in respect of whom principally all this was prepared) hee onely
      by reason of his sickenesse was absent from this shewe, and not
      long after the departure of these ships, the lamentable and most
      sorrowfull accident of his death followed.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

  <p>Other accounts of this incident represent the King as being carried out
    to see this gallant spectacle, the last he was to see upon earth.</p>

  <p>The little fleet met with bad weather off the coast of Spitzbergen; two
    of them, including the captain’s ship, ran into a harbour of Lapland,
    where the whole company were frozen to death; the third got into
    the White Sea and so to Archangel; the captain, Richard Chancellor,
    procured sledges and travelled to Moscow, where he obtained from the
    Czar permission to trade on the northern coast of Russia. Thus was
    founded the Russia Company. A few years later one of the agents of the
    Russia Company was despatched as an Ambassador from the English Court
    to the Czar, who in his turn sent an Ambassador to Whitehall. On his
    voyage the Russian Ambassador was wrecked on the coast of Scotland.
    The Russia Company, hearing of the disaster, sent a deputation with a
    supply of everything that the Ambassador might want. On his approach to
    the City he was met by a company of eighty merchants on horseback, who
    escorted him to Highgate, where he lay that night, and on the next day
    was met by Lord Montague, representing the Queen, with 300 knights and
    esquires and 140 merchants of the Russia Company. Rooms were found for
    him in Gracechurch Street, where many costly gifts awaited him.</p>

  <p>The history of this Company deserves to be written at length on
    account of the enterprise and intelligence of its agents. Indeed,
    justice has never been done to the agents and factors of the great
    London Companies. It was not the Directors, sitting at home at their
    long table, who created the Indian Empire; maintained and widened the
    English trade; carried the English flag over lands unknown and to
    peoples unheard of; it was not the Directors who opened up routes,
    stood before capricious despots, marked the resources of new countries
    and reported on their wants. These things were done by the factors and
    the agents, who encountered all risks, facing possibly prison, torture,
    disease, and sometimes a cruel death, for the enlargement of trade and
    the enrichment of their masters. They were the pioneers; sometimes they
    were the Forlorn Hope of the English trade and wealth. No Company, not
    even the East India Company, was better served by its agents than the
    Russia Company. They obtained from the Czar important privileges; they
    could trade in any part of Russia without safe conduct or licenses;
    they could not be arrested for debt; they could appoint their own
    officers and servants; and they had jurisdiction over all Englishmen
    resident in Russia. In other words, they had a monopoly of the Russian
    Trade.</p>

  <p>The Company showed a clear comprehension of these advantages; they
    continued to attempt the north-east passage; they sent ships laden
    with merchandise to Archangel, whence their agents travelled over
    Russia; they even opened communications with Persia by means of their
    agent Anthony Jenkinson, who has already in his own words given us an
    account of his adventurous career. When he sailed from the Volga
    to Astrakhan, he passed over the Caspian to the town of Boghaz, where
    he found traders from the Far East. He sent home a map of Russia, the
    first published in England. This way of trade, however, proved too
    dangerous on account of Cossack pirates who infested the Caspian Sea
    and robbed the Company’s ships. However, the Company, anxious to secure
    these advantages, procured an Act of Parliament granting them the
    exclusive trade with the countries of Persia, Armenia, and Media, as
    well as Russia.</p>

    persevered in their voyages of discovery, once more attempting the
    north-east passage, which was expected to do so much for them. They
    did not succeed, but they discovered the deep sea fisheries, and they
    brought home immense quantities of fish-oil and of dried salmon. They
    suffered from the Dutch, who followed in their wake; they obtained
    from the King of Denmark permission to put in at any of his seaports
    in Iceland or Norway; they lost their exclusive rights in Russia, but
    only for a time; they found themselves cut out by the Dutch, whose
    vessels carried more merchandise; with the authority of James the
    First, they sent armed vessels and seized on Spitzbergen in the King’s
    name, calling it King James’s Newland. They had to fight for their
    conquest, driving off Dutch, French, and Biscay sail with four English
    “interlopers.” The Dutch, however, would not admit the pretensions
    of Crown or Company, sending their ships protected by men-of-war to
    fish, despite the protests of the English. There was fighting in the
    high latitudes for some years, while even the English ports refused
    to recognise the exclusive right of the Company. Finally, the whales
    became so scarce about Spitzbergen that the trade ceased to be worth
    fighting about.</p>

  <p>We will continue the history of the Company in brief, though it runs
    far beyond the limits of our period. In the year 1620 the route by the
    Caspian was reopened by Hobbs, an agent to the Company, who took that
    way from Moscow to Ispahan. In 1623 a new treaty was concluded between
    James the First and the Czar, in which privileges, but not exclusive
    rights, were conferred upon the Company. A deadly blow was inflicted
    on the Company by the execution of Charles, an event naturally viewed
    by all sovereigns with the deepest indignation. The English merchants,
    who were masters of the Russian trade, were driven out and supplanted
    by the Dutch; and it was not until the year 1669 that the Company was
    allowed to trade with Russia on the same footing as the Dutch.</p>

  <p>The real importance of the Company was decaying when it admitted any
    one as a member on payment of a fine of £5. The conveyance of raw silk
    from Persia through Russia remained their privilege until troubles
    broke out in Persia in 1746, which stopped the trade; they still
    carried on their trade with Archangel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> but when the Baltic became a
    peaceful highway, this shorter route to Russia destroyed the Archangel
    trade. The Russia Company did not, it is true, acquire for the British
    Empire any accession of territory; but its services in exploring new
    routes, opening up new lines of trade, putting Great Britain into
    communication with foreign powers previously strangers, can hardly be
    exaggerated, while it fostered and encouraged and developed that spirit
    of enterprise, adventure, and restlessness which, since the seventeenth
    century, has covered half the globe with one people and one religion.</p>

  <p>A distinction must be drawn between “regulated companies” and
    Joint-Stock Companies. In the former, every man traded for himself,
    subject to the regulations of the Company, like a Guild. In the
    “Russia,” “Turkey,” and “Eastland” Companies no one but a member could
    carry on that kind of trade. In the Joint-Stock Companies shareholders
    need not be traders and could sell or transfer their shares.</p>

  <p>The Eastland Company was first chartered in 1579. It was privileged to
    enjoy the sole trade over all those parts of the Baltic shore which
    did not belong to the Russia Company. Now there had been carried
    on, from time immemorial, a trade with the Baltic ports by private
    adventurers who wanted no charter. Many of these, no doubt, took up
    their membership with the new Company, but there were some who would
    not, or could not. These traders, driven away from their own markets,
    made loud complaints, in reply to which a proclamation was issued
    ordering that no one outside the Company was to export to these parts
    the merchandise in which the Eastland Company traded; provided always
    that the importation of corn and grain was left free. The provision
    looks like a compromise, but when we ask how corn and grain were to be
    imported except in ships, and that, if these ships were English, they
    would hardly go out in ballast, one fails to see that the enemies of
    the Eastlanders got much by their proclamation. In 1672 the whole of
    Scandinavia was thrown open to all comers; and the entrance-fee to the
    Company was reduced to £2. The opinion of Sir Josiah Child probably
    settled the fate of the Company. He said that the Eastland Company had
    only enabled the Dutch to get ten times as much trade in the Baltic as
    was carried on by the English.</p>

  <p>In the year 1581 the Turkey Company received its Charter from Queen
    Elizabeth. It was a Charter for a limited time, seven years, and it
    could be revoked at a year’s notice. The Company began very well;
    they built large and strong ships to face the storms of the Bay, for
    which they received the thanks of the Council; they introduced eastern
    commodities at a much cheaper price; but they sometimes paid dearly for
    their cargoes when they had to fight the corsairs of Barbary and the
    galleys of Spain, and to face the fiercest animosity of the Venetians.
    In 1583 some of the agents of the Company, stationed at the Aleppo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
    House, made their way with merchandise to Bagdad, to the Persian
    Gulf, and thence to India and the Far East. They obtained, therefore,
    a new Charter giving them power to trade over India as well as the
    Sultan’s dominions. The entrance-fee was fixed at £25 for persons under
    twenty-six years of age, at £50 for those over twenty-six, and at £1
    for apprentices.</p>

  <p>The Company now became extremely prosperous, carrying on a most
    extensive trade. This trade, by a later order under Charles II., was
    kept entirely in the hands of the City of London, no one, unless
    a resident and a freeman, being admitted into the Company. On the
    foundation of the East India Company there arose disputes as to the
    infringement of rights. This quarrel ended without any decision.</p>

  <p>The trade of the Turkey Company declined during the seventeenth century
    from many causes, one of which was the rivalry of the French and their
    success in underselling the English goods. The Company finally closed
    its history in the year 1825.</p>

  <p>The Levant Company was another trading Company established under
    Elizabeth. By opening up direct communication with the Levant, England
    procured all the productions of the East without the intervention of
    Venice. Only one more vessel was sent to London from Venice after the
    establishment of the Company, and this with a rich cargo and many
    passengers was wrecked and destroyed on the Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p>For the repulse of the Spanish Armada, London contributed thirty-eight
    vessels, and the Society of Merchant Adventurers, ten. In 1591, or
    perhaps in 1589, the first voyage from London to the East Indies was
    undertaken. The expedition of 1591 consisted of three ships, of which
    one was never heard of again; and the other two lost many men from
    sickness. The expedition, however, led to the formation of the East
    India Company in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1600, with a capital of £72,000 in 1440 shares
    of £50 each. Their first fleet, consisting of five ships and 480 men,
    reached Sumatra and the Straits of Malacca, where they captured a
    Portuguese ship of 900 tons laden with calicoes. They settled a factory
    at Bantam and sailed homewards, returning to port in two years and
    seven months after starting.</p>

  <p>The trade of the country was greatly advanced by the immigration of
    many Flemings, Dutch, Walloons, and French Huguenots, who brought over
    with them their own trades. They were judiciously distributed about
    the country, care being taken that they should neither interfere with
    the trade of the place nor crowd too much together. Thus at Sandwich
    alone there were 350 Flemish families in the year 1582; they carried
    on the manufactory of bags. In Norwich, Dutch and Walloons settled and
    made serges and silks and bombazines. Bone lace was taken to Honiton
    from Antwerp. In London the Flemings settled at Bermondsey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> where they
    made felt hats and did joiners’ work; at Bow, where they had dye-works;
    at Wandsworth, where they worked in brass; at Mortlake and Fulham,
    where they made tapestry. In other places workers in steel and iron,
    window-glass painters, cloth fullers, cloth-makers, and many other
    craftsmen were planted and carried on profitable industries. Among
    other things, sail-making was introduced into England for the first
    time. The pawnbroker’s shop was also opened in this reign. It began
    with the establishment of seven banks in as many towns, to be known as
    “Banks for the relief of Common Necessity,” which should lend money on
    pledges. This Bank is alluded to by Shakespeare when Sir John Falstaff
    urges his hostess to pawn her cups and her hangings. “Glass,” he says,
    “glass is your only drinking: and for thy walls, a pretty slight
    drollery, or the story of the Prodigal or the Germans hunting in water
    work, is worth a thousand of these bed hangings and these fly-bitten
    tapestries.”</p>

  <p>The monopoly system by which the Court rewarded favourites at the
    expense of trade and the people was regarded by Elizabeth with favour,
    as an easy way of bestowing favours costing herself nothing. Many of
    her monopolies she withdrew as manifestly injurious to trade, yet she
    left many which weighed heavily upon the enterprise of the country.
    These monopolies were multiplied in the next two reigns, and greatly
    assisted to bring about the unpopularity of Charles.</p>

  <p>Cunningham is of opinion that the borrowing of money for trading
    purposes was not a common practice; he bases this opinion on the very
    high rate of interest demanded by the usurer. There can be no doubt
    that usury was strictly forbidden by the Church, by the Ordinances of
    the City of London, and by public opinion. Yet a case quoted by him
    (<i>Growth of Trade</i>, p. 325) shows that men not only wanted to borrow
    from time to time, but that Christians, not Jews, were willing to lend
    on interest. In that case the lender wanted interest for a loan of £10
    for three months, which amounted to 80 per cent per annum. The usurer
    could not get his claim allowed. Yet it is difficult to understand how
    business could be carried on at all except in an elementary way, if
    there was neither credit nor borrowing. But was the rate of interest
    too high for trading on borrowed money? There is every reason to
    believe that the profits of trade were enormous. Malyns, in his <i>Centre
      of the Circle of Commerce</i>, gives a table showing the profits of the
    trade in spices, silk, indigo, etc., early in the seventeenth century.
    They range from 150 to 250 per cent, <i>i.e.</i> goods bought at £100 would
    sell for £250 up to £350. Of course there must be set off against this
    apparently huge profit, losses by wrecks and pirates and the expense
    of the shipping. Borrowing, Cunningham thinks, was necessary to meet
    taxation. Since taxes were not regular, but irregular; and could not be
    provided for because no one knew when a tallage would be imposed or how
    large a percentage would be demanded, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> merchant or the landowner,
    though perfectly solvent, might not be able to lay his hand at once on
    the amount demanded. A person of to-day whose estate might be worth
    £120,000 would find it, very possibly, difficult to meet, within a few
    days, the King’s demand of one-fifteenth, that is £8000. If he could
    not realise in time he must borrow. If all the usury was confined to
    the lending of money to meet a sudden tax, or to a monastery for the
    building of a church, or for a baron to raise a force, what becomes
    of the popular hatred of the Jews, first as money-lenders, and of
    the Caursini and the Italians who were licensed by the Pope, next?
    And if there was no borrowing by the merchants, what was the meaning
    of that crowd which, after the massacre of the Jews in York Castle,
    rushed to the Cathedral, where they brought out the Jews’ bonds—their
    own bonds—and burned them all? Cunningham, in a note, enumerates
    the demands of certain Russians against the Jews of the present day.
    These demands express the popular belief concerning their practice,
    not the truth. One would most unwillingly accept prejudice for proof,
    especially in the case of the race which has endured so much prejudice
    for so many centuries. Cunningham says, very justly, that the real
    objection against the Jews was that they made their money by lending
    it on security, which left them no risks which could be foreseen. The
    common people, however, did not understand the objection; they saw that
    the Jews practised a trade which the Church and the State would not
    allow to Christians; they saw that the Jews grew rich rapidly; that
    they were protected by the King; that they waxed insolent and sometimes
    insulted the Christian religion; and if they lent a Christian money
    they demanded an enormous, a ruinous, interest for it. Deep, indeed,
    must have been the popular hatred of the Jews, since Shakespeare could
    stir the blood of his audience by the spectacle of a Jewish usurer,
    three hundred years after there had been Jews in the land.</p>

  <p>The business of the daily life, as well as that of the mercantile life,
    cannot, in fact, be carried on without money-lending. Works cannot
    be undertaken; credit cannot be secured; cargoes cannot be bought;
    ships cannot be laden; unless money can be obtained by advance. The
    banishment of the Jews; the disappearance of the Italians; took away
    the usurers and money-lenders by profession. There were as yet no
    banks to make advances on security; and money-lending was still, as it
    remains to this day, an occupation held in the greatest loathing. The
    money-lender, therefore, disguised his calling. Thus Hall (<i>Society in
      the Elizabethan Age</i>) furnishes a sketch of the usurer of the period.
    His name was George Stoddart; by trade he was ostensibly a grocer, but
    really a money-lender. His bargains took the form of bets. Thus he
    sends J. Klynt his furred nightgown for 4s. 5d., to be paid on the day
    of Klynt’s marriage: he gives R. Leds a ring called a ryboys, which
    he values at £1:13:4, to be paid on the day of his marriage or else
    at his hour of death. For a rapier he charges 40d., to be paid at his
    day of marriage or else not. He gives a man £400 on the condition that
    during his lifetime the borrower shall pay him £80 a year. He lived
    for ten years, and so doubled that small capital of £400. It would be
    interesting to know what, if any, great City fortunes were made by this
    style of money-lending.</p>

  <p>The increase of trade and of shipping in the Port of London is
    indicated by a passage in Camden, when he speaks of the multitudes of
    ships “as a very wood of trees, disbranched to make glades and to let
    in the light: so shaded is it with masts and sails.”</p>

  <p>The watermen of London were those who lived by the river and the port.
    John Taylor, the water poet, says that 40,000 people lived by the
    labour of the oar and scull. In 1613 there was a petition from the
    Company of Watermen against the erection of a theatre on the London or
    Middlesex side of the river, because it drew away so many people who
    otherwise would have been carried across the river to the theatres on
    the south bank. John Taylor shows us that many of these watermen had
    been sailors:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I did briefly declare part of the services that watermen had
      done in Queen Elizabeth’s reign of famous memory, in the voyage
      to Portugal with the right honourable and never to be forgotten
      Earl of Essex; then after that, how it pleased God, in that great
      deliverance in the year 1588, to make watermen good serviceable
      instruments with their loss of lives and limbs to defend their
      prince and country. Moreover, many of them served with Sir Francis
      Drake, Sir John Hawkins, Sir Martin Frobisher, and others. Besides,
      in Cadiz action, the Island Voyage, in Ireland, in the Low
      Countries, and in the narrow seas they have been, as in duty they
      were bound, at continual command, so that every summer 1500 or 2000
      of them were employed to the places aforesaid....</p>

    <p>Afterwards the players began to play on the Bankside, and to leave
      playing in London and Middlesex, for the most part, then there went
      such great concourse of people by water that the small number of
      watermen remaining at home were not able to carry them, by reason
      of the court, the terms, the players, and other employments, so
      that we were enforced and encouraged, hoping that this golden
      stirring world would have lasted ever, to take and entertain men
      and boys ... so that the number of watermen, and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span> that live
      and are maintained by them, and by the only labour of the oar and
      the scull, betwixt the bridge of Windsor and Gravesend, cannot be
      fewer than forty thousand; the cause of the greater half of which
      multitude, hath been the players playing on the bankside, for I
      have known three companies besides the bear-baiting at once there,
      to wit, the Globe, the Rose, and the Swan.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Loud complaints being made by the artificers of London that foreign
    goods were underselling theirs, the King in 1461 prohibited the
    importation or sale of the following articles—the list of which shows
    some of the manufactures at that time established in London:—</p>

    VII. passed an Act forbidding any stranger, <i>i.e.</i> foreigner, to buy
    or sell merchandise in the City; in his reign also was passed an Act
    to compel the country people to resort to the City. For it was ordered
    that no citizen should carry goods to any market or fair out of the
    City. The people of the country represented to Parliament the great
    hardship of being obliged to travel all the way to London in order to
    procure things that could only be bought in London, viz. chalices,
    books, vestments, and other church ornaments, victuals for Lent, linen
    cloths, woollen cloths, brass, pewter, bedding, iron, flax, wax, and
    other things. The Parliament interfered and the order was removed.</p>

  <p>Under Henry VII. commercial treaties were concluded with the Danes and
    with the Florentines. There was a quarrel with Burgundy and a cessation
    of commercial relations for three years. In 1497 (12 Hen. VII.) was
    passed an Act entitled “Every Englishman shall have free recourse to
    certain foreign marts, without exaction to be taken by any English
    fraternity.” The meaning of the Act was this: the Merchant Adventurers’
    Company had arrogated to themselves the right of refusing the right of
    trade in any foreign port until a fine or fee of £40 should first be
    paid to themselves. The Act defined the extent of English foreign trade
    at the time. The Merchant Adventurers sent their vessels to Spain,
    Portugal, Brittany, Flanders, Holland, Ireland, Normandy, France,
    Venice, Dantzic, Eastland, Friesland, and other parts. The Parliament
    allowed the fine, but limited it to ten marks, or £6:13:4. We have seen
    the jealousy and hatred of foreigners shown by the envious outbreak of
    “Evil May Day” in 1517 (p. 24).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> The complaints or the justification
    of the rioters was that there were so many foreigners employed as
    craftsmen that the English could get no work; that foreign merchants
    brought in all silk, cloth of gold, wine, etc., and that no one,
    almost, bought of an Englishman; that the foreign merchants exported
    so much wool, tin, and lead, that English adventurers could not make
    a living; that they forestalled the market, buying up everything all
    round the City, so that nothing of value came to the City markets,
    while some of them imported all kinds of goods that were made in this
    country, such as nails, locks, baskets, cupboards, stools, tables,
    chests, girdles, saddles, and printed cloths.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest transcribers of MSS., that is to say, publishers of books,
    the monks, not only transcribed MSS., but they sold their copies,
    the sale of books forming part of the monastic revenues. These books
    were either plain copies for common use, as the service books and
    the school books, or they were illuminated, bound with decorations
    of gold and silver, costing very large sums. When, however, as
    happened in the fifteenth century, the demand for books increased,
    while the revenues, and therefore the numbers, of the religious in
    the monasteries decreased, the multiplication of books fell into the
    hands of laymen. In some cases the monks themselves employed laymen as
    transcribers. There grew up various branches of the book trade: the
    maker of parchment, pens, ink, colours for illumination; the writers,
    the binders, the illuminators, and the sellers. As regards the value
    of books at any time, it is impossible to estimate it, because we must
    first learn the purchasing power of money, which is very difficult
    to ascertain; <i>e.g.</i> the price of wheat, sheep, fowls, etc., is a
    very fallacious test, because we do not know the standards of the
    time. The wage test is the safest guide. For instance, six pounds
    a year was thought sufficient pay for the maintenance of a chantry
    priest—a man considered superior to the ordinary craftsman, yet not
    very high in the social scale. In addition we must know the whole
    conditions of production; the cost of materials, the time taken by
    transcribers for a page or a sheet, the demand, the competition, and
    everything else connected with the work. Some of these points have
    been cleared up, but most of them can never be cleared up. It must be
    sufficient to understand that there was a large demand for books, and
    that many collections of books were formed by princes and prelates
    and monasteries. It was a providential circumstance that the art of
    printing was well advanced at the time of the Dissolution of the
    Religious Houses. Otherwise the losses, which were great indeed, might
    have been very much greater, even irreparable.</p>

  <p>The first printers in the City of London were Caxton’s workmen,
    Wynkyn de Worde and Richard Pynson. The former set up his press in
    Fleet Street, “over against the Conduit,” which stood at the end of
    Shoe Lane; the latter, outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> Temple Bar. In the course of the
    century, however, the number of printers rapidly increased, and in
    the reign of Elizabeth the number of books published in any branch
    was extraordinary. Nothing can show more conclusively the general
    avidity for learning and for the possession of books in every branch
    of knowledge. When, indeed, we consider that the yearly output of
    books in Great Britain and America now amounts to some 10,000 (a large
    number of them new editions), which at an average of 1000 each means
    10,000,000 volumes among a population of 120,000,000, who nearly all
    read, without counting India, which alone contains millions of readers,
    and when we remember that the whole reading public of England amounted
    to a few thousands, it is clear that the Elizabethan output was beyond

  <p>It could not be long before a censorship of the Press was established.
    In 1526 the printing of books against the Catholic Faith was
    prohibited. Later on, that of books defending the Catholic Faith was in
    turn prohibited.</p>

  <p>It was in 1557 that the very singular powers were conferred upon the
    Company of Stationers of suppressing and prohibiting books either
    seditious or heretical. These powers were absolute and subject to no
    appeal. Why the Company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> Stationers was entrusted with powers which
    belonged to the Bishop of London and the Ecclesiastical Courts does
    not appear. However, the Company exercised this authority for two
    years, when Queen Elizabeth ordered that no book should be printed
    without a license being first obtained. She then, illogically, granted
    monopolies to certain printers and booksellers for the sale of certain
    books specified: to one for the sale of Bibles; to another for sale
    of catechism; to a third for that of music-books; and so on. To the
    Stationers she granted the monopoly of psalters, primers, almanacks, A
    B C, the “little Catechism,” and Nowell’s English and Latin Catechism.
    The printer, however, was already separating from the bookseller. As
    yet there was no such thing recognised as the author’s rights over his
    own property. In many cases he did not wish his name to appear; the
    publisher did what he pleased with the MS.</p>

  <p>Among the early booksellers was Richard Grafton, who was printer,
    bookseller, and author as well. He reprinted and continued Hall’s
    <i>Chronicles</i>. Other publishers and booksellers of the sixteenth century
    were Robert Redman, who quarrelled with Richard Pynson; Henry Pepwell,
    who died in 1539; John Day, for whom John Foxe, who wrote the <i>Book
      of Martyrs</i>, worked. He issued a Church music book. He also published
    Bibles, Sermons, and A B C’s. Day had shops successively in Holborn,
    Aldersgate Street, and St. Paul’s Churchyard. William Middleton, whose
    shop was in Fleet Street, near St. Dunstan’s Church, was both printer
    and bookseller. He published Heywood’s <i>Four P’s</i>, and an edition of
    Froissart.</p>

  <p>Henry Smyth, Redman’s son-in-law, was the publisher of Littleton’s
    <i>Tenures</i>. Richard Tottell, whose shop was within Temple Bar, published
    Tusser’s <i>Hundred Good Points of Agriculture</i>, Grafton’s <i>Abridgment
      of the Chronicles of England</i>, and Stow’s <i>Summary of the Chronicles
      of England</i>. Harrison of St. Paul’s Churchyard published Shakespeare’s
    <i>Venus and Adonis</i> in 1593, but it was printed by Richard Field, a
    fellow-townsman of the poet. In 1594 Harrison published <i>The Rape of
      Lucrece</i>. The publication of the plays, however, belongs mostly to the
    seventeenth century. But <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Richard II.</i>, <i>Richard
      III</i>, <i>Henry IV.</i> Part I., <i>Love’s Labours Lost</i>, were published
    at this time, and in 1600 <i>Henry IV.</i> Part II., <i>Much Ado About
      Nothing</i>, <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>Titus
      Andronicus</i>, and <i>Henry V.</i> all came out. In all, eleven of the plays
    were published in the sixteenth and the rest in the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>There was an astonishing number of printers and booksellers. Thus, in
    addition to the names mentioned above, we may note those of Middleton,
    Richard Field, Harrison, father and son, William Leake, Wise, Aspley,
    Ling, and Nathaniel Butler, Ponsonby, Edward White, Cadman, Burby,
    Warde, William Barley, Humphrey Hooper, John Budge, Thorpe, and Norton.</p>

  <p>Already the bitterness of the author against the publisher has begun.
    Drayton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> speaks of the booksellers as “a company of base knaves, whom
    I scorn and kick at.” Complaint was made concerning a book called <i>A
      Petite Palace of Petties his Pleasure</i> (1576), that the printer had
    suppressed the name of the author, and his preface, and had substituted
    his own name with a preface by himself. Again, the authors complained
    of the advertising tricks employed to increase the sale of a book.
    Thus, Ben Jonson addresses his bookseller:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“‘Thou, that mak’st gaine thy end, and wisely well</div>
        <div class="i2">Call’st a book good, or bad, as it doth sell,</div>
        <div class="i2">Use mine so, too: I give thee leave. But crave</div>
        <div class="i2">For luck’s sake it thus much favours have,</div>
        <div class="i2">To lie upon thy stall till it be sought;</div>
        <div class="i2">Not offer’d, as it made suit to be bought:</div>
        <div class="i2">Nor have my title-leaf on post, or walls,</div>
        <div class="i2">Or in cleft-sticks, advanced to make calls</div>
        <div class="i2">For termers or some clerk-like serving-man,</div>
        <div class="i2">Who scarce can spell th’ hard names: whose knight scarce can;</div>
        <div class="i2">If, without these vile arts it will not sell,</div>
        <div class="i2">Send it to Bucklersbury, there ‘twill well.’”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Unfortunately, also, the bitterness of the author against the
    bookseller was accompanied by bitterness against his fellow-craftsmen.
    Thus Barnaby Rich says:—</p>

  <p>“‘One of the diseases of this age is the multitude of books, that doth
    so overcharge the world that it is not able to digest the abundance of
    idle matter that is every day hatched and brought into the world, that
    are as divers in their forms as their authors be in their faces. It is
    but a thriftless and a thankless occupation, this writing of books:
    a man were better to sit singing in a cobbler’s shop, for his pay is
    certain a penny a patch, but a book-writer, if he gets sometimes a few
    commendations of the judicious, he shall be sure to reap a thousand
    reproaches of the malicious.’” (W. Roberts, <i>Earlier History of English
      Bookselling</i>.)</p>

  <p>This brief view of bookselling in the sixteenth century may be taken
    to include also the first twenty years of the seventeenth, after which
    certain changes appear in the trade and in the relations of author and
    publisher.</p>

  <p>Little has been said, so far, concerning the connection of London
    with literature. The history of literature belongs to the nation, not
    to London. Yet London could even before the Elizabethan age boast of
    Chaucer, Gower, Skelton, Lydgate, all of whom, at some time in their
    lives, resided in London. And what a list, what a splendid list, is
    presented of the London poets in the reign of Gloriana! This list
    alone, without counting the poets who went before or the poets who
    came after, is sufficient in itself to place England in the forefront
    of modern literature. Consider some of the names. Shakespeare, Ben
    Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Beaumont, Fletcher, Ford, Peele, Marston,
    Sackvile, Sylvester, Spenser, Raleigh—one could go on till the page
    became a catalogue. I have counted two hundred and forty Elizabethan
    poets whose names, with many of their works, have survived to the
    present day. In the same proportion we, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> can hardly number sixty
    poets, ought to have now 5000. But in that time expression assumed the
    form of poetry first and the drama afterwards; men who had a thing to
    say, or a theory to state, said it in poetry, just as a man who had a
    tale to tell presented it in the form of a drama. Not that poetry or
    the drama were the only things. The Elizabethan age was rich in every
    form and branch of literature; it had books of chivalry, as <i>The Seven
      Champions</i>; story books, as <i>The Gesta Romanorum</i>; jest books, as
    Skogan’s, Tarleton’s, Skelton’s, Peele’s; pastoral romances, as <i>The
      Arcadia</i>; “picaresque” novels, as those of Nash and Dekker; histories,
    as those of Holinshed, Stow, Grafton; essays, as those of Bacon,
    Ascham, Sir Thomas Browne; satires, as those of Hall and Marston;
    translations from the French and the Italian. Not even in these days
    is there a better, larger, fresher supply of new literature. It was
    above all fresh; everything was new; people did not look backwards in
    literature; they lived in the present; at no other time in the history
    of the world was the present more delightful; more full of hope, more
    full of joy, more full of daring. There was a new religion, not yet
    crystallised into Puritanism: a religion in which every man, for the
    first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> after more than a thousand years, stood up before his
    Maker without an interposing priest; there was a new learning, full of
    wonder and of delight; there were new arts; there was a new world, a
    larger world, full of mysteries and monsters and undiscovered marvels;
    there was a new pride sprung up among the people; new adventures were
    possible; there were new roads to riches; England held a nobler place
    among the nations; everything seemed possible; the wildest extravagance
    was permitted in talk, in song, in the drama, in enterprise. Companies
    could be formed to go anywhere, and to do everything. Countries there
    were everywhere to be conquered, or, at least, to trade with; no longer
    did ocean set bounds, no longer did continents stretch forth forbidding
    capes: the nobler spirits were arriving at a clearer grasp and
    understanding of what lay before them; the machinations of Spaniard,
    Pope, and Priest were, it seemed, finally defeated; everything was
    ready for the work of such men as Raleigh and Drake. Then, alas!
    Gloriana died, and the world of poetry sank sadly back into prose, and
    that for the most part of the tamest and the most creeping; an age
    followed when King and people were no longer in touch; when foreign
    politics were a betrayal and a surrender; when the whole dream of the
    King was not to extend and enrich his realm, but to encroach upon the
    people’s liberties, and the whole power of the people was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> required to
    resist the encroachments of the King. How mean and miserable is the
    policy of Charles compared with that of Elizabeth! How paltry are the
    pretensions of King and Archbishop! How wretched, save for the figure
    of the great Protector, is the history of the seventeenth century,
    compared with the history of the sixteenth under the great Queen!</p>

  <p>Harrison furnishes a contemporary opinion on “the new veine of
    writing”:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This further is not to be omitted, to the singular commendation
      of both sorts and sexes of our courtiers here in England, that
      there are verie few of them, which have not the use and skill of
      sundrie speaches, beside an excellent veine of writing before time
      not regarded. Trulie it is a rare thing with us now, to hear of a
      courtier which hath but his owne language. And to saie how many
      gentlewomen and ladies there are, that beside sound knowledge of
      the Greeke and Latine toongs, are thereto no lesse skilful in the
      Spanish, Italian, and French or in some one of them, it resteth
      not in me; sith I am persuaded, that as the noblemen and gentlemen
      do surmount in this behalfe, so these come verie little or nothing
      at all behind them for their parts, which industrie God continue,
      and accomplish that which otherwise is wanting.”... “The ladies of
      the court employ themselves in continuall reading either of the
      holie scriptures, or histories of our owne or forren nations about
      us, and diverse in writing volumes of their owne, or translating
      of other mens into our English and Latine toongs.”... “Finallie,
      to avoid idlenesse, and prevent sundrie transgressions, otherwise
      likelie to be committed and doone, such order is taken, that
      everie office hath either a bible, or the booke of the acts and
      monuments of the church of England, or both, beside some histories
      and chronicles lieing therein, for the exercise of such as come
      into the same; whereby the stranger that entereth into the court
      of England upon the sudden, shall rather imagine himselve to come
      into some public schools of the universities, where manie give eare
      to one that readeth, than unto a princes palace if you conferre
      the same with those of other nations. Would to God all honorable
      personages would take example of hir graces godlie, dealing in
      this behalfe, and shew their conformitie unto these hir so good
      beginnings which if they would, then should manie grievous offenses
      (wherewith God is highlie displeased) be cut off and restreined,
      which now doo reigne exceedinglie, in most noble and gentlemen’s
      houses, whereof they see no paterne within hur graces gates.”
      (Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles</i>.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Leaving the great masters, let us consider a little the more popular
    literature of the day; the kind which has its run among the people
    and is forgotten; the current literature, the books of the time, the
    works which were bought and read by those of the citizens who read at
    all, probably as large a proportion as we should find at the present
    day, when the newspaper is the only reading of multitudes. It is
    not difficult to arrive at what constituted a library. There were
    religious books, such as Hooper’s <i>Sermons</i>; there were collections of
    songs, such as <i>The Court of Venus</i>, against which the clergy spoke
    vehemently; books of chivalry and novels in great numbers, such as
    <i>Bevis of Hampton</i>, <i>Guy of Warwick</i>, <i>Arthur of the Round Table</i>,
    <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i>, <i>Oliver of the Castle</i>, <i>Four Sons of Aymon</i>,
    <i>The Witless Devices of Gargantua</i> and <i>Howleglas</i>. There were the
    English stories, <i>Robin Hood</i>, <i>Adam Bell</i>, <i>Friar Rushe</i>, <i>The Foole
      of Gotham</i>. There were satires and fables; <i>Æsop</i>, Erasmus’s <i>Praise
      of Folly</i>, <i>The Schoolhouse of Women</i>, <i>The Defense of Women</i>, <i>Piers
      Plowman</i>, <i>Raynolde the Fox</i>, <i>The Palace of Pleasure</i>. There were
    translations, as <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, and <i>Apulosius</i>; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> were books
    of instruction, as <i>The Boke of Carvynge</i>, <i>The Boke of Cokerye</i>,
    <i>The Boke of Nurture for Men servants</i>, <i>The Boke of Fortune</i>, <i>The
      Boke of Curtesey</i>, <i>The Boke of Chesse</i>, and <i>The Hundred Points of
      Good Husserye</i>. These titles are taken from actual lists before me;
    the presses were extremely active and the output of books was very
    considerable during the whole of Elizabeth’s long reign. In a word,
    there was as great a variety of books for the reader’s choice as there
    is now, setting aside the modern books in science; there were poets by
    the hundred, dramatists, novelists of all kinds, historians, preachers,
    moralists, and essayists. It would take too much space and time were I
    to attempt an estimate or an account of the Elizabethan literature.</p>

  <p>There was, however, one form of literature then playing a very
    important part in the education of the people which has been too much
    neglected by those who write of the sixteenth century. It was the
    ballad. In the last century, if a man had a thing to say, he wrote a
    pamphlet; at present if he has a thing to say and desires that the
    people at large should hear it, he either casts it into the form of a
    novel, or he sends it to the papers as a letter or as a communication.
    The Elizabethan, on the other hand, cast it into the form of verse;
    the ballad expressed the popular opinion; by means of the ballad
    that opinion was formed and taught; by means of the ballad events
    were recorded and remembered. Every event produced its own ballad. I
    have before me a list of a hundred ballads, taken at random from the
    registers of the Stationers’ Company, published for the Shakespeare
    Society in 1849 by Payne Collier. From these registers it is evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
    that the ballad, as sung in private houses, in taverns, at fairs, and
    where people congregated; in the streets, in the markets, and at the
    Carrefours where stood the Cross and the Conduit, taught and led the
    people as the Press now teaches and leads them. There was a great
    competition in the production of new ballads; the printers vied with
    each other in getting the latest or the most striking event turned
    into ballad form and put upon the market. These ballads were written
    on every conceivable subject. In order to illustrate their importance
    I have compiled the following list roughly classified. The titles in
    almost all cases indicate the contents and aim of the ballad. Some of
    them are very well written.</p>

  <p>This list might be multiplied indefinitely. Enough has been given to
    show that the ballad was the principal medium by which the people were
    moved and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> taught. One would not underrate the power of the sermon.
    At no time, not even in the seventeenth century, was the sermon more
    powerful than under Elizabeth; but the sermon chiefly treated of
    doctrine and the ballads taught morals and the conduct of life. Nay,
    in these cases, which were many, when a ballad secular, amatory,
    scandalous, or immoral, had become popular, the clergy took it in hand
    and moralised it: <i>i.e.</i> presented a religious parody of it, which they
    persuaded the people to sing instead of the first version. For example,
    here is part of a “moralised” ballad:—</p>

  <p>We must not forget to take account in this brief review of the topical
    writings of the day of the difference of dialect. It is not too much
    to say that a Norfolk countryman would not understand a Kentish lad;
    and that a Yorkshire man would talk a strange tongue to a man of the
    Midlands. Caxton says, writing a little earlier:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Englishe that is spoken in one shire varyeth from another;
      insomuch, that in my dayes happened, that certain merchaunts were
      in a ship in Tamyse, for to have sailed over the see into Zelande,
      and for lacke of wynde they taryed att Forland, and went to land
      for to refresh them; and one of them, named Sheffelde, a mercer,
      came into a hows, and axed for mete, and specially he axed for
      egges; the good wyfe answerde that she could speke no French. And
      the merchaunt was angry, for he also could speake no French; but
      wolde have egges, and she understode hym not. And thenne at last
      another sayd, that he would have ceyren; thenne the good wyfe said,
      that she understode him.”</p>

  <p>In the year 1592 was published a book in prose and verse by Richard
    Johnson, entitled <i>The Nine Worthies of London</i>, inscribed to Sir
    William Webbe, Lord Mayor of London. Its wide popularity proves that
    it presents some, at least, of the ideas current among the people.
    To begin with, the “Nine Worthies” are not by any means, with one
    exception, those ancient citizens whom we should now consider of the
    greatest renown. We do not find here the names of Thomas à Becket,
    Whittington, Philpot, or Gresham. The things worthy to be remembered
    are neither enterprise in trade, nor vigilance in guarding the
    liberties of the City, nor the acquisition of wealth, nor charities
    and endowments. The only thing worthy to be remembered, even among
    citizens of London, is prowess of arms. The “Nine Worthies” come out,
    one after the other, and relate their own achievements. It is certain
    that Richard Johnson did not himself select these men for honourable
    mention, because they are clearly referred to in a passage of the
    <i>Paradise of daintie Devices</i>:—</p>

  <p>Fifth, John Bonham, citizen and mercer, who went to Denmark with his
    merchandise, there was received at Court and distinguished himself at
    a tournament—the only occasion on record of a merchant fighting in a
    tournament—and finally led an army to victory over the Great Solyman,
    who made him a knight after the defeat of the Turk:—</p>

  <p>Sixth, Christopher Croker. Alas! the world has forgotten Christopher.
    He was a vintner’s ’prentice. He was loved by Doll Stodie, his master’s
    daughter; and he burned to give her a better position; he joined the
    army of the Black Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> in France; distinguished himself there; went
    with him to Spain, and returned a knight:—</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Seventh, John Hawkwood, the Prince of Mercenaries. He, too, belonged to
    the Black Prince and was knighted by him.</p>

  <p>Eighth, Hugh Caverley, silk weaver, who also became a knight in France
    and signalised himself afterwards by slaying a monstrous wild boar
    which devastated Poland.</p>

  <p>Ninth, and last, Henry Maleverer, grocer, Knight Crusader and Custodian
    of Jacob’s Well:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“And thus with love, with honour, and with fame,</div>
        <div class="i3">I did return to London whence I came.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is a curious list, and shows what legends of former citizens had
    grown up in the minds of the people. They had clean forgotten the old
    Patron Saints of London, St. Erkenwald and St. Thomas à Becket; they
    had forgotten Philpot and his splendid achievement over the pirates
    of the North Sea; they had forgotten Waleys, Mayor of Bordeaux and of
    London; they had forgotten Dick Whittington; they had even forgotten
    Gresham, and in place of the men who had made London and brought
    wealth, prosperity, and freedom to the town, they remembered mythical
    adventures and traditions of battle and of victory. One would like to
    know more about the popular belief in “London Worthies.”</p>

  <p>The wholesale destruction of MSS. and mediæval libraries, at the
    Suppression of the Religious Houses, though doubtless a heavy loss from
    an artistic point of view, considering the loss of illuminated books,
    may be considered as compensated by the increased activity of the
    press and the reconstruction of the library. What was actually lost to
    literature? John Bale tells us, Manuscripts of the Fathers, Schoolmen,
    and Commentators. Was this a loss? It is quite certain that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
    monkish commentators regarded their text from a point of view no longer
    held: the Holy Scriptures, they said, were lost. The manuscript copies
    were very likely lost, but the press multiplied copies. I think that
    the greatest loss to literature was the loss of certain chronicles,
    of which we have so many left, which relate the history of current
    events as the monkish scribe heard and understood them. In any case,
    the destruction of so many books made it impossible, henceforward, to
    consider a library as made up chiefly of manuscripts; the press rapidly
    restored the books that were wanted; and gave the world a library
    filled with printed books, while the old commentators were clean
    forgotten.</p>

  <p>The age of great folios and mighty scholars was the seventeenth,
    rather than the sixteenth, century. In the sixteenth, scholars were
    busy in putting forth new editions of the classics. Men like Dolet and
    Rabelais were not ashamed to correct for the press. The voluminous
    commentator came afterwards. Meantime, it is remarkable that we had
    no Rabelais among our writers. He, formerly a friar, came out of the
    cloister, his head filled with the old learning and eager for the new.
    His great book became at once popular, and was eagerly passed from hand
    to hand. The origins of his chapters have quite recently been explored
    and discovered in Mr. W. F. Smith’s excellent translation. They are
    shown to be chiefly extracts from gloss and commentary, burlesqued,
    imitated, and held up to the ridicule and scorn of scholars. The common
    people understood only the bubbling mirth and laughter, coupled with
    the spontaneous unseemliness of the page; the scholar understood the
    allegory and the purpose of the writer; the ecclesiastic alone, and
    one of the older type, understood the true nature of the overwhelming
    contempt and hatred of the order that was passing away—contempt and
    hatred thinly veiled and concealed except for those who knew the gloss
    and commentary of the past. We have no Rabelais; among all our friars
    there was no scholar; among our ejected monks, if there were scholars,
    they stuck by their order; among all the priests, monks, and friars,
    who joined in the Reformation, there was not one who so despised the
    old faith as to make it the theme of such a book as that of Rabelais.
    Hatred there was in plenty, after the fires of Smithfield: hatred which
    continued to flourish in our literature and still lingers; but not the
    full bitterness of hatred, fear, contempt, and restlessness which fill
    the pages of Rabelais, Étienne Dolet, and Bonaventure des Periers.</p>

  <p>Painting in London practically began with the Tudors, and was brought
    over to the City by Flemish and Dutch painters. Among these we find
    the names of Lucas and Gerard Horenbout, Volpe, Gerbud Flick, Johannes
    Corvus, Levina Terling, Susanna Horenbout, and Alice Carmillion. But
    the great name of Holbein towers above all the rest. This painter was
    born at Augsburg about 1497, went to Basle in 1516, and came to London
    in 1526. He continued in London, with the exception of three visits to
    Basle, until his death in 1543, residing first in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> lodging on London
    Bridge, and next in a house in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft,
    where he died.</p>

  <p>As regards his contemporaries and successors, we are indebted to
    the researches of the late John Gough Nichols for information on
    this point. They are embodied in a paper published by the Society of
    Antiquaries (xxxix. p. 19).</p>

  <p>The earliest Court Painter to Henry VIII. was one John Browne. He
    was appointed in 1511 a Serjeant Painter with a salary of twopence
    a day and four ells of cloth, valued at 6s. 8d. an ell, annually.
    Three pounds a year is not a large salary, but probably he was paid
    in addition for any work which he might do; thus, he was paid forty
    shillings for a painted tabard of sarsenet provided by him for
    Nottingham Pursuivant. In 1522 he was elected Alderman for Farringdon
    Without, and in 1525 he was discharged from office without having been
    either Sheriff or Mayor. He gave by will to the Painter Stainers’
    Company his house for their hall: the present Hall stands upon the site
    of Browne’s bequest.</p>

  <p>John Browne was succeeded as Serjeant Painter by Andrew Wright. This
    painter received £30 for painting and decorating the King’s barge. He
    had a manufactory of “pink,” a vegetable pigment used by painters at
    that time; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> was the Italian <i>giallo santo</i> and the French <i>stel de
      grain</i>. Wright died in 1543.</p>

  <p>Vincent Volpe, a contemporary of the two preceding, supplied, in 1514,
    streamers and banners for the King’s great ship, the <i>Henry Grace à
      Dieu</i>. He is called in 1530 the “King’s Painter.” It is suggested that
    it was Volpe who painted some of the military pictures at Hampton
    Court. He also received money for the decoration of the King’s barge.
    The “King’s Painter” seems to have held a higher rank than the Serjeant
    Painter, for Volpe’s salary was £10 a year.</p>

  <p>Two other Flemish artists, Lucas and Gerard Horenbout, were also in
    the receipt of salaries from the King; their father was also, perhaps,
    a painter and a Fleming. Their sister Susanna was a painter of
    miniatures. She was the wife, first, of Henry Parker the King’s bowman,
    and, secondly, of a sculptor named Worsley.</p>

  <p>An Italian named Antonio Toto was a native of Florence, the son of a
    painter and the pupil of Ridolpho. He was architect as well as painter.
    His principal building was the strange palace of Nonsuch (see <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).
    Toto was, like Andrew Wright, a Serjeant Painter. For the coronation of
    Edward VI. he provided the tabards for the heralds; he also took charge
    of the masques.</p>

  <p>Another Italian attached to Henry’s Court was Bartolomo Penni. The
    names of three women have been given above: Alice Carmillion was in
    Henry’s service; Levina Terling in Edward’s, Mary’s, and Elizabeth’s
    successively.</p>

  <p>Holbein’s most illustrious successor among his contemporaries was
    Guillim Streets, or Strettes. Among other paintings by this admirable
    artist was one of the marriage of Queen Mary. The picture, however, is
    lost.</p>

  <p>Nicholas Lyzarde was Serjeant Painter to Queen Elizabeth. He died in
    1571.</p>

  <p>The names Antonio Moro and Joost van Cleef may also be added to those
    of the painters who lived in London during the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>The decay of the London schools and of learning in general, which
    undoubtedly began in the fifteenth century and continued until far
    into the following century, is difficult to understand. One can only
    form theories and make guesses. The fact cannot be disputed. There
    were forces at work which have not been recorded. The Lollardry of the
    late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries seems to have been in
    great measure forgotten. Yet, as I have pointed out and proved, the
    custom of making bequests to the Religious Houses declined and decayed
    until it quite died away, long before the Reformation. The old spirit
    of revolt left behind it a steady and persistent and growing spirit
    of dissatisfaction. Perhaps this spirit was shown in the decay of the
    monastic schools. We have seen how, in 1477, four of the London clergy
    asked, and obtained, permission to found additional schools in four
    parishes. The new schools could do little; the Reformation accelerated
    the decay of learning partly by the abolition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> monastic schools;
    partly by the vast reduction in the number of ecclesiastics; partly
    by the loss of the endowments by which learning had been encouraged
    and maintained: an increased trade, with foreign enterprise, also
    attracted the younger men in numbers continually increasing. So few
    were the undergraduates of Oxford that in Queen Mary’s reign only three
    took a degree in Divinity during the space of six years; in Civil Law
    only eleven; in Physic six; in Arts an average of about twenty-three.
    Anthony à Wood writes: “There were none that had any heart to put their
    children to any school, any farther than to learn to write—to make
    them Apprentices or Lawyers.”</p>

  <p>I would enumerate among the causes of the general decay in learning:
    (1) the unsettled nature of religious opinions; (2) the changed ideas
    concerning education; (3) the destruction of the Houses, which, if
    they turned out few scholars, offered a quiet home for the studious;
    (4) the advance in trade and enterprise, which attracted the youth of
    London far more than study; (5) the contempt into which the mass of
    the Protestant clergy had fallen; (6) a feeling of uneasiness about
    scholarship, lest it should bring one to the stake, of which there had
    been presented many terrifying examples.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

  <p>Of music there is a much nobler record. Never before had the people
    been such great lovers of music, and such admirable proficients. In
    every barber’s shop was hung a zither or a guitar; anybody played;
    everybody sang. Henry VIII. himself was a composer of no mean
    capability, and a performer equal to any. Elizabeth upon the virginals
    was unequalled. Many of the anthems and madrigals of the period survive
    to this day and are still sung. The music of the Chapel Royal was
    held to be better than anything of the kind in Western Europe. Would
    that the musical tastes and traditions of London had been preserved!
    They were destroyed by the Puritans. They were destroyed slowly but
    effectively. At the Restoration it was still the custom for gentlemen
    to play and sing; but not, apparently, for the trading and lower
    classes; during the last century, neither gentlefolk nor any other folk
    could play or sing; music ceased to be cultivated by the people. Nor
    have we yet, even, begun to be a people given to music; it is still
    comparatively rare to find boys who are taught to play any instrument;
    at no public school is it thought to be an essential part of education.
    Perhaps the twentieth century may witness a revival of the national
    love for music.</p>

  </div>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems impossible to ascertain why these names were bestowed upon the
    City Giants. The prophet Ezekiel (chs. xxxviii. and xxxix.) prophesies
    against “Gog, the land of Magog, the Chief Prince of Meshech, and
    Tubal.” In the Book of Revelation (xx. 8) Satan goes out “to deceive
    the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and
    Magog.” How were these names applied to City Giants? It was a common
    thing to have a City Giant who was carried in processions; there
    were giants at Chester, Salisbury, and Coventry; there were giants
    at Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Douai, Lille, and Brussels. The giants
    were in every case connected in some way with the legendary history
    of the City. But while every city had its own giant, who was brought
    out on festive occasions, this did not prevent the construction of
    other giants. Thus, after the victory of Agincourt, when Henry V.
    was received by a pageant of extraordinary splendour, a giant and a
    giantess stood on the Southwark end of London Bridge to greet him.
    The giant carried in his right hand an axe, and in the left the City
    keys, as if he were the porter of the town. In 1432, when Henry VI.
    came to England after his Coronation in France, there was another giant
    at London Bridge. He stood with drawn sword, and had at his side the
    following verses written out large:—</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In 1547, when the boy-king Edward passed through the City, among the
    figures presented to him were two representing Valentine and Orson.</p>

  <p>In 1554, when Philip came to London, there was a great pageant to
    receive him with the Queen. At the drawbridge of the Tower there were
    placed the two giants, Corineus and Gogmagog, holding between them a
    scroll inscribed with Latin verses.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p>In January 1559, when Queen Elizabeth rode through the City she was
    received with a pageant of great splendour. At Temple Bar the last show
    was that of the two City Giants, Corineus and Gogmagog, who had between
    them a recapitulation of the whole pageant. Here the singing children
    made a “noise,” while one of them, attired like a poet, bade the Queen
    farewell in the name of the City.</p>

  <p>The giants seem to have been omitted from the Royal pageants and
    processions of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>In 1605 the Lord Mayor’s Pageant was adorned by the presence of the
    giants.</p>

  <p>“The first Pageant was ‘The Shippe called the Royall Exchange,’ in
    which takes place a short poetical dialogue between the master, mate
    and boy, who congratulate themselves on the fortunate termination of
    their voyage at this auspicious time, the master ending the dialogue by
    a punning allusion to the Mayor’s name, when he declared his intention</p>

  <p>Neptune and Amphitrite appear upon a lion and camel; and Corineus and
    Gogmagog, two huge giants, ‘for the more grace and beauty of the show,’
    were fettered by chains of gold to ‘Britains Mount,’ the principal
    pageant; which they appeared to draw, and upon which children were
    seated, representing Britannia; ‘Brute’s divided kingdoms,’ Leogria,
    Cambria, and Albania; ‘Brute’ himself, his sons Locrine, Camber, and
    Albanact; Troya Nova, or London; and the Rivers Thames, Severn, and
    Humber, who each declaim in short speeches, the purport of which is
    that as England, Wales, and Scotland were first sundered by Brutus to
    supply his three sons with a kingdom each, they are now again happily
    united in ‘our second Brute,’ King James the first.” (Fairholt, <i>Lord
      Mayor’s Pageants</i>.)</p>

  <p>The giants disappeared from the Lord Mayor’s Pageants soon after this.
    In 1633, Clod, a country-man, in Shirley’s <i>Contention for Honour and
      Riches</i>, says:—</p>

  <p>“When the word is given, you march to Guildhall, with every man his
    spoon in his pocket, where you look upon the giants, and feed like
    Saracens, till you have no stomach to Paul’s in the afternoon.”
    (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

  <p>In the Lord Mayor’s Pageant for 1673 the giants came out again. This
    pageant was designed by Thomas Jordan. It appears to have been their
    first appearance after the Fire.</p>

  <p>“I must not omit to tell you, that marching in the van of these five
    pageants, are two exceeding rarities to be taken notice of; that is,
    there are two extreme great giants, each of them at least fifteen foot
    high, that do sit and are drawn by horses in two several chariots,
    moving, talking, and taking tobacco as they ride along, to the great
    admiration and delight of all the spectators; at the conclusion of
    the show they are to be set up in Guildhall, where they may be daily
    seen all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> the year, and I hope never to be demolished by such dismal
    violence as happened to their predecessors; which are raised at the
    peculiar and proper cost of the city.” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

  <p>It would seem that in many of the pageants it was not thought necessary
    to set down the fact that the giants formed part, for in Henley’s
    Orations (1730–1755) there is one on the Lord Mayor’s Show which
    contains the following passage: “On that day, the two giants have the
    priviledge, if they think it proper, to walk out and keep holiday; one
    on each side of the great horse would aggrandize the solemnity, shew
    consisting often in bulk.” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

  <p>In Stow’s description of the setting of the watch on Midsummer’s Eve,
    he says: “The Mayor had, beside his giants, three pageants, whereas
    the Sheriffs had only two, besides their giants.” In Marston’s <i>Dutch
      Courtezan</i>, acted 1605, an allusion is made to the giants: “yet all
    will scarce make me so high as one of the gyant’s stilts that stalks
    before my Lord Mayor’s Pageants.”</p>

  <p>George Wither (1661) calls the giants “Big-boned Colbrant and great
    Brandsmore.”</p>

  <p>The last appearance of the giants in a procession was in 1837, when
    they graced the Lord Mayor’s Show.</p>

  <p>The legends of the City Giants were two in number. The first related
    how Brutus, one of the Trojan heroes, wandering after the Fall of Troy,
    like Æneas, came to Britain, which he found full of giants. He fought
    with these giants and destroyed them all except two, named Gog and
    Magog, whom he brought to his new City of London and chained to the
    palace gates. Another legend relates how Corineus, brother of Brutus,
    fought the giants Gog and Magog, and, being himself stronger than his
    unwieldy antagonists, threw them headlong into the sea. The two giants
    of Guildhall, according to this legend, were Corineus and Gogmagog. The
    names of Gog and Magog were certainly taken either from Ezekiel or the
    Book of Revelation, and were applied to the giants after Corineus had
    been forgotten, as the names of princes over an infidel people: they
    were represented, not as tutelary giants, but as conquered giants. It
    will be observed that one is represented as a Roman, with helmet and
    shield, sword, spear, and armour, while the other is apparelled, after
    the artist’s imagination, as an ancient Briton.</p>

  <p>They were originally made of wicker-work; after the Great Fire, which
    destroyed them, they were reconstructed of the same materials, but in
    1707 they were made of wood, as we now see them.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter we can make a large use of contemporary literature.
    Thus, the first consideration in treating of the manners and customs of
    the people is naturally the position of the wife and the consideration
    shown to her. I do not think that in any country could either the
    position of the wife or the consideration for her surpass what was then
    in vogue in London. This point Emanuel van Meteren, writing in 1575,
    makes abundantly clear, even while he contends the exact opposite, viz.
    that the wife is entirely in the power of the husband. For he shows
    that whatever the law may be—he does not quote the law—the practice
    is that the wife has entire liberty; and custom, <i>i.e.</i> public opinion,
    against which no husband would dare to move, secures her that liberty.
    This is what he says:—</p>

  <p>“Wives in England are entirely in the power of their husbands,
    their lives only excepted. Therefore when they marry, they give up
    the surname of their father and of the family from which they are
    descended, and take the surname of their husbands, except in the
    case of duchesses, countesses, and baronesses, who, when they marry
    gentlemen of inferior degree, retain their first name and title, which,
    for the ambition of the said ladies, is rather allowed than commended.
    But although the women are entirely in the power of their husbands
    except for their lives, yet they are not kept so strictly as they are
    in Spain, or elsewhere. Nor are they shut up, but they have the free
    management of the house or housekeeping, after the fashion of those of
    the Netherlands and others their neighbours. They go to market to buy
    what they like best to eat. They are well-dressed, fond of taking it
    easy, and commonly leave the care of household matters and drudgery
    to their servants. They sit before their doors, decked out in fine
    clothes, in order to see and be seen by the passers-by. In all banquets
    and feasts they are shown the greatest honour; they are placed at
    the upper end of the table, where they are the first served; at the
    lower end they help the men. All the rest of their time they employ
    in walking and riding, in playing at cards or otherwise, in visiting
    their friends and keeping company, conversing with their equals (whom
    they term gossips) and their neighbours, and making merry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> with them at
    child-births, christenings, churchings, and funerals; and all this with
    the permission and knowledge of their husbands, as such is the custom.
    Although the husbands often recommend to them the pains, industry,
    and care of the German or Dutch women, who do what the men ought to
    do both in the house and in the shops, for which services in England
    men are employed, nevertheless the women usually persist in retaining
    their customs. This is why England is called the Paradise of married
    women. The girls who are not yet married are kept much more rigorously
    and strictly than in the Low Countries. The women are beautiful, fair,
    well-dressed and modest, which is seen there more than elsewhere, as
    they go about the streets without any covering either of mantle, hood,
    veil, or the like. Married women only wear a hat both on the street
    and in the house; those unmarried go without a hat, although ladies of
    distinction have lately learnt to cover their faces with silken masks
    or vizards, and feathers,—for indeed they change very easily, and that
    every year, to the astonishment of many.”</p>

  <p>If this was the ordinary life of the London merchant’s wife, the
    following is the contemporary ideal (Gervase Markham):—</p>

  <p>“Next unto her sanctity and holiness of life, it is meet that our
    English Housewife be a woman of great modesty and temperance, as well
    inwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behaviour and carriage
    towards her husband, wherein she shall shun all violence of rage,
    passion and humour, coveting less to direct than to be directed,
    appearing ever unto him pleasant, amiable and delightful; and tho’
    occasion of mishaps, or the mis-government of his will may induce her
    to contrary thoughts, yet vertuously to suppress them, and with a
    mild sufferance rather to call him home from his error, than with the
    strength of anger to abate the least spark of his evil, calling into
    her mind, that evil and uncomely language is deformed, though uttered
    even to servants; but most monstrous and ugly, when it appears before
    the presence of a husband; outwardly, as in her apparel, and dyet, both
    which she shall proportion according to the competency of her husband’s
    estate and calling, making her circle rather strait than large; for it
    is a rule, if we extend to the uttermost, we take away increase; if
    we go a hair’s breadth beyond, we enter into consumption; but if we
    preserve any part, we build strong forts against the adversaries of
    fortune, provided that such preservation be honest and conscionable;
    for as lavish prodigality is brutish, so miserable covetousness is
    hellish. Let therefore the Housewife’s garments be comely and strong,
    made as well to preserve the health, as to adorn the person, altogether
    without toyish garnishes, or the gloss of bright colours, and as far
    from the vanity of new and fantastick fashions, as near to the comely
    imitation of modest matrons. Let her dyet be wholesome and cleanly,
    prepared at due hours, and cook’d with care and diligence, let it
    be rather to satisfie nature, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> her affections, and apter to
    kill hunger than revive new appetites; let it proceed more from the
    provision of her own yard, than the furniture of the markets; and let
    it be rather esteemed for the familiar acquaintance she hath with it,
    than for the strangeness and rarity it bringeth from other countries.</p>

  <p>To conclude, our English Housewife must be of chaste thoughts, stout
    courage, patient, untired, watchful, diligent, witty, pleasant,
    constant in friendship, full of good neighbourhood, wise in discourse,
    but not frequent therein, sharp and quick of speech, but not bitter
    or talkative, secret in her affairs, comfortable in her counsels, and
    generally skilful in the worthy knowledges which do belong to her
    vocation.”</p>

  <p>But to set against this is the testimony of the Elizabethan satirist
    Philip Stubbes.</p>

  <p>The principal occupation of the women, he tells us—their daily
    life—is to lie in bed till nine or ten in the morning; to spend two
    hours in dressing themselves; then to go to dinner; then, “their heads
    pretely mizzeled with wine,” they walk abroad for a time; or they sit
    at their open doors showing their braveries to passers-by; or they
    pretend business in the town and carry a basket, “under what pretence
    pretie concerts are practised.” Or again they have those gardens in the
    fields outside already alluded to, whither they repair with a boy and a
    basket and meet their lovers.</p>

  <p>In the streets a lady of condition was preceded by a lackey carrying a

    badge in silver on the left arm. The men kept on their hats indoors
    except in warm weather.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> The nobles, who were mostly poor, joined
    with the merchant adventurers in their foreign enterprises; many of
    the merchants were consulted by the Sovereign and held positions of
    trust—for example, Gresham; yet the separation of City and Court was
    already beginning, as is shown by the repeated sneers of the dramatists
    at the vulgarity and ostentation of the City Madams. We get occasional
    glimpses of the lower class women and girls; they were rough in their
    manners and coarse in their conversation; we find them dancing in the
    street to the music of the tabor and the pipe; we also see them playing
    at ball up and down the street, like the ’prentices. They lived, like
    the men, on strong meat and beer; they were therefore physically
    strong, perhaps as strong as the young men their lovers. The richer
    sort of citizens had country gardens, generally small enclosures,
    either in or north of Moorfields, whither they resorted in the long
    summer evenings; their wives, it is said, used the gardens in the
    morning for assignations and the carrying on of intrigues.</p>

  <p>In the morning the haunt of the gallants was St. Paul’s Cathedral.
    (<i>See</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_VIII">Appendix VIII.</a>) They walked up and down the middle of the nave,
    called then the “Mediterranean,” exhibiting their new cloaks and their
    new feathers. After a few turns up and down, or when the clock struck
    eleven, they left the place and disappeared, going to some of the
    shops, the tobacconist’s, or the bookseller’s, where they took tobacco
    and talked about the new books. They then repaired to an ordinary and
    spent two or three hours over dinner, after which they went back to St.
    Paul’s and spent there the whole afternoon.</p>

  <p>The merchant had his Exchange; the citizen his tavern; the gallant had
    the apothecary’s shop, where he bought and smoked his tobacco. For
    daily discourse and business the scholar, the divine, the poet, the
    wit, had the bookseller’s shop. “He will sit you,” said Ben Jonson, “a
    whole afternoon in a bookseller’s shop, reading the Greek, Italian,
    and Spanish.” He would read, and he would talk. Remember that in the
    year 1590 or thereabouts the art of printing had only been in use a
    hundred years; all the books were new books; every poet was printed
    or translated for the first time; the booksellers’ shops contained
    editions, always new, of ancient classics; of living poets; of foreign
    writers; there was far greater interest in a new book than our age can
    understand: as we have seen there were in London alone at least 240
    poets, known and acknowledged, whose names are still remembered, and
    whose poems still remain Anthologies, and there was interest among the
    reading world in every one of them. There may have been jealousies:
    poets have always been a jealous folk; but there was appreciation, and
    there was generosity. And the bookseller’s shop was the place where all
    who valued new books could meet and talk of books—what talk is more
    delightful? What criticism more sincere than that between those who
    themselves belong to letters in an age when literature knows not yet
    the meaning of the words exhaustion or decay?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Ordish (<i>Shakespeare’s London</i>, p. 233) has compiled a list of
    Elizabethan booksellers from the title-pages of the Shakespeare
    quartos. Such a list was well worth making, though it cannot be
    considered more than a small instalment. Indeed, the literary output
    was so enormous during the latter half of the sixteenth century, that
    the number of booksellers must have been proportionately greater than
    at present.</p>

  <p>The following were some of the signs:—</p>

  <p>I. In St. Paul’s Churchyard—</p>

  <p class="lefthang ml8">At the sign of the Angel, the Fox, the Flower de Luce and the
    Crown, the Greyhound, the Green Dragon, the Holy Ghost, the Gun
    (Edward White), the Pied Bull, the Spread Eagle.</p>

  <p>II. By St. Dunstan’s in the West—</p>

  <p class="lefthang ml8">At the sign of the White Hart; at the shop under the Dial.</p>

  <p>III. In Paternoster Row—</p>

  <p class="lefthang ml8">At the sign of the Sun.</p>

  <p>IV. Cornhill—</p>

  <p class="lefthang ml8">At the sign of the Cat and Parrots.</p>

  <p>V. In Carter Lane, near the Paul Head.</p>

  <p>Plays and masques were performed on Sunday as well as any other day;
    the feeling, however, was growing rapidly in favour of a stricter
    attention to the Sunday, which was confused with the Sabbath. In other
    words, the Puritans were fast increasing in numbers and in importance.</p>

  <p>If amusement was wanted it might also be sought in the street, where
    the juggler with his music and his tumbler had his regular round. He
    was distinguished by his thin, coloured cloak and his yellow breeches
    trimmed with blue. For a modest fee he performed for any who summoned
    him. Another form of amusement, suitable to those who could not afford
    to pay the itinerant juggler, and had to consider the expenditure in
    candles, was to sit round the fire in the evening and tell stories.</p>

  <p>In the private houses there was a great deal of whipping; gentlemen
    had their servants whipped in the porter’s lodge; to be whipped was
    no disgrace, but a natural part of servitude, no more to be deplored
    than the necessity of death;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> ladies whipped their maid-servants, their
    sons and their daughters; when a child had been whipped the rod was
    tied to her girdle, with what we should perhaps consider an excess of
    admonition. Children knelt before their parents until bidden to rise.
    On their knees, too, they asked for their father’s blessing. If we
    may believe Caxton, who died in 1491, and therefore hardly belongs to
    the Tudor period, there was a great falling off in the behaviour of
    children in his own recollection. It is a mark of increasing years
    to compare things of the present with things of the past to the
    disparagement of the former.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I see that the children ben borne within the sayd cyte encrease
      and prouffyte not like their faders and olders; but for mooste
      parte, after that they ben comeyn to theyr perfight yeres of
      discretion and rypnes of age, kno well that theyre faders haue
      lefte to them grete quantite of goodes, yet scarcely among ten two
      thrive. O blessed Lord! when I remember this, I am al abashed;
      I cannot judge the cause; but fayrer ne wyser, ne bet bespeken
      children in theyre youth ben no wher than ther ben in London; but
      at ther ful ryping, there is no carnel, ne good word found en, but
      chaff for the most part.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As for the boys of the household, they either went to one of the City
    schools or they were instructed by a tutor at home. Probably the latter
    was unusual when schools were ready to hand. In country places the
    tutor was common, and his position was anything but pleasant.</p>

  <p>“Such is the most base and ridiculous parsimony of many of our
    Gentlemen (if I may so terme them) that if they can procure some poore
    Batchelor of Art from the Universitie to teach their children to say
    grace, will be content upon the promise of ten pounds a yeere at his
    first comming, to be pleased with five; the rest to be set off in hope
    of the next advouson (which perhaps was sold before the young man was
    born). Or if it chance to fall in his time, his lady or master tels
    him, ‘Indeed, Sir, we are beholden unto you for your paines; such a
    living is lately falne, but I had before made a promise of it to my
    butler or bailiffe, for his true and extraordinary service.’</p>

  <p>Is it not commonly seen, that the most Gentlemen will give better
    wages, and deale more bountifully with a fellow who can but a dogge,
    or reclaime a hawke, than upon an honest, learned, and well qualified
    man to bring up their children? It may be, hence it is, that dogges
    are able to make syllogismes in the fields, when their young masters
    can conclude nothing at home, if occasion of argument or discourse be
    offered at the table.”</p>

  <p>Did the great City merchant ever maintain the domestic chaplain? I have
    found no instance of such a servant in the household of a citizen.

  <p>As regards the ’prentices, they were considered as servants not only
    in the shop and warehouse, but also at home, where they waited at
    dinner, and followed the ladies to church and when they went abroad in
    the evening, carrying a lantern and a stout cudgel. For the servants,
    properly so called, the following regulations will show the manner of
    their service (Drake, ii.):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Imprimis, That no servant bee absent from praier, at morning or

  <p>The London merchant’s house in the sixteenth century steadily improved
    in solid comfort and even in magnificence. No one will ever be able to
    restore completely, or even approximately, the London of that century.
    We do not know the numbers of the great houses; we know only in part
    their constitutions, their pictures; their art; their carved work. In
    the streets lying off the main avenues of retail trade, especially
    in those streets near the riverside, a house was frequently at once
    a place of residence and a warehouse. One may look upon a street in
    Hildesheim, for instance, and be reminded of Bishopsgate Street,
    Aldgate, or Leadenhall Street in the time of Queen Elizabeth. That is
    to say, the greater number of houses were timbered with tiled roofs;
    the fronts all covered with carvings painted and gilded; there were
    scattered here and there substantial stone houses; there were still
    many houses whose gateway opened from some narrow city lane upon a
    spacious court, above which stood the hall; the lady’s bower; the rooms
    for apprentices and servants; and, behind all, the garden. Such a house
    on a large scale was Gray’s Inn; on a lesser scale Barnard’s Inn and
    the smaller inns. The College of Heralds still shows the general size
    of the court; Doctor’s Commons until fifty years ago also illustrated
    the old fashion of building. Bricks were coming into use, but, in the
    City of London, slowly. There were still many narrow and noisome courts
    where the hovels were of wood—making a constant danger of fire and
    filled with all manner of decaying abominations—a constant cause of
    disease.</p>

  <p>By this time all the windows were provided with glass; many of the
    poorer sort, however, were furnished with the cheap glass which
    contained the round lumps called bull’s eyes. The shops in the
    market-places had glass in the upper part, but the lower part still
    remained open, and was shut at night with a shutter. The goods were
    exposed outside the window, and the ’prentices stood beside them
    bawling, “What d’ye lack? What d’ye lack?”</p>

  <p>In the more important houses the old custom of living in the great hall
    was still kept up. In all houses the servants and apprentices sat down
    with the master and his family.</p>

  <p>The floors were still strewn with rushes, but these, on account of
    the cost of renewing, were seldom changed, so that underneath them,
    as Erasmus discovered, lay unmolested an “ancient collection of beer,
    grease, fragments of fish, and everything that is nasty.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

  <p>The furniture of the rooms was very different from that of our own
    times. The following account is taken from <i>Archæologia</i> (vol. xxx. p.
    2):—</p>

  <p>“The Furniture of the different rooms is very similar, varying
    principally in number and quality of the articles; consisting of
    sets of hangings, tables with tressels, joined forms, joined stools,
    court-cupboards, carpets, cushions, and a few chairs; also andirons,
    and other fire utensils, and several pairs of virginals in different
    rooms, besides a pair of organs in the chapel, and ‘an instrument
    musicall’ in the chamber of presence. The carpets, which are numerous,
    would scarcely appear to have been used according to modern custom
    for the floors of the apartments, Hentzner having informed us, that
    the presence-chamber of Queen Elizabeth herself was strewed with hay
    (<i>i.e.</i> rushes) but they were principally coverings for the tables,
    stools, and court-cupboards; though they may have been occasionally
    used to cover some select part of a room, as in the presence-chamber,
    for instance, where a Turkey carpet is mentioned, five yards and a half
    long, and two yards and three-quarters broad.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_277"><img src="images/i_277.jpg" width="558" height="514" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">STAPLE INN, HOLBORN</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

  <p>The court-cupboards, which are generally considered to have been
    moveable closets, answering the purpose of a sideboard, were frequently
    much ornamented, and such an article may still be seen in old mansions,
    and in collections of old furniture. They were covered with carpets or
    cupboard cloths, and set out with cups, salvers, and plate. Some of
    these carpets were very handsome. In one of the inventories in that
    valuable authority for researches of this nature, the <i>History of
      Hengrave</i>, is mentioned, ‘One carpet of black velvet, for the little
    bord, laced and fringed with silver and gould, lyned with taffita.’
    Some of these carpets also had cloths to lay over them, probably, when
    not in use, in order to protect them. In the same Inventory cushions
    are mentioned which in richness exceed those of the Archbishop, as
    ‘two long cushions of plain black velvet, embroidered with roses, with
    gould and pearle all over, with tassels of gold and silk’; but the
    nature of his archi-episcopal office probably induced him to avoid too
    much splendour in his household. There is, however, in the chamber of
    presence a cushion of cloth of baudkin,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and in other apartments,
    several cushions of velvet and damask. The chair of cloth of gold and
    silver in the gallery was probably a State chair; and, indeed, from
    the paucity of these articles, they would seem to be intended only for
    persons of higher rank. From the ‘latten andirons’ in the chamber of
    presence being valued at forty shillings, it may be inferred that they
    were ornamented, and in some cases we know they were richly carved.
    Iachimo, describing the chamber of Imogen, says:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i20">‘Her andirons—</div>
        <div class="i0">I had forgot them—were two winking Cupids</div>
        <div class="i0">Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</div>
        <div class="i0">Depending on their brands.’</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The pictures are chiefly portraits of royal personages, the principal
    noblemen and officers of state, and the promoters of the Reformation,
    but the list is interesting to shew the Archbishop’s selection. In some
    of the bed-rooms are truckle-beds (trundle-beds as they are called in
    some of the inventories of this age); these would seem to have been
    small beds generally appropriated to attendants, and placed at the foot
    or side of the standing or principal bed, and occasionally made to run
    under it during the day. The Host in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
    in answer to an inquiry after Sir John Falstaff, says, ‘There’s his
    chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and truckle-bed.’
    Hudibras also makes the distinction:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">‘If he that in the field is slain,</div>
        <div class="i0">Be in the bed of honour lain.</div>
        <div class="i0">He that is beaten may be said,</div>
        <div class="i0">To lie in honour’s truckle-bed.’</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In my Lord’s chamber the bed is a field-bed, but this sort of bed may
    have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>so called from being a folding-bed, as field-stool from
    fauld-stool, and not as being a camp-bed or <i>lit de champ</i>. The ‘grene
    satten of bridgs’ in the vestrye was satin of Bruges; and ’dornix,’ of
    which there are some articles mentioned, is used for ‘Tournay,’ and
    applied to the manufacture of that place. The ‘Grene saie,’ in the
    ‘Grene Galery,’ and elsewhere, was probably not silk, but a species
    of fine cloth (sagum), one of the earliest productions of our woollen
    manufacture, the material of stockings, which were objected to by
    William Rufus, as being, from the price, too common for a king.”</p>

  <p>We may supplement this account by Harrison’s description (Holinshed, i. 317):—</p>

  <p>“The furniture of our houses also exceedeth, and is growne in maner
    even to passing delicacie; for herein I doo not speake of the nobilitie
    and gentry onlie, but likewise of the lowest sort in most places of
    our south countrie, that have aniething at all to take to. Certes
    in noblemen’s houses it is not rare to see abundance of Arras, rich
    hangings of tapistrie, silver vessell, and so much other plate, as may
    furnish sundry cupbords, to the summe often times of a thousand or
    two thousand pounds at the least: whereby the value of this and the
    rest of their stuffe dooth grow to be almost inestimable. Likewise
    in the houses of knights, gentlemen, merchantmen, and some other
    wealthie citizens, it is not geson to behold generallie their great
    provision of tapistrie, Turkie worke, pewter, brasse, fine linen, and
    thereto costlie cupbords of plate, worth five or six hundred or a
    thousand pounds, to be deemed by estimation. But as herein all these
    sorts doo far exceed their elders and predecessors, and in neatnesse
    and curiositie the merchant all other; so in time past, the costlie
    furniture staied there, whereas now it is descended yet lower even
    unto the inferior artificers and manie farmers, who by vertue of their
    old and not of their new leases have for the most part learned also to
    garnish their cupbords with plate, their joined beds with tapestrie and
    silke hangings, and their tables with carpets and fine naperie, whereby
    the wealth of our countrie (God be praised therefore and give us grace
    to imploie it well) dooth infinetlie appeare. Neither doo I speak
    this in reprooch of anie man, God is my judge, but to showe that I do
    rejoise rather to see how God has blessed us with His good gifts; and
    whilest I behold how that in a time wherein all things are growen to
    most excessive prices, and what commoditie soever is to be had is daily
    plucked from the communaltie by such as looke into every trade, we do
    yet find the meanes to obtein and achive such furniture as heretofore
    hath beene unpossible. There are old men yet dwelling in the village
    where I remaine, which hath noted three things to be marvellously
    altered in England within their sound remembrance; and other three
    things too much increased. One is, the multitude of chimnies lately
    erected, whereas in their yoong daies there were not above two or
    three, of so many in most uplandish towns of the realme (the religious
    houses and manour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> places of their lordes alwaies excepted, and
    peradventure some great personages), but each one made his fire against
    a reredosse in the hall where he dined and dressed his meat.</p>

  <p>The second is the great (although not generall) amendment of lodging,
    for (said they) our fathers (yea and we ourselves also) have lien full
    oft upon straw pallets, on rough mats covered onlie with a sheet under
    coverlets made of dagswain or hopharlots (I use their owne terms) and
    a good round log under their heads insteed of a bolster or pillow. If
    it were so that our fathers or the good man of the house, had within
    seven yeares after his marriage purchased a matteres or flockebed, and
    thereto a sacke of chaffe to reste his head upon, he thought himselfe
    to be well lodged as the lord of the towne, that peradventure laie
    seldom in a bed of downe or whole fethers: so well were they contented,
    and with such base kind of furniture: which also is not verie much
    amended as yet in some parts of Bedfordshire, and elsewhere further off
    from our southerne parts. Pillowes (said they) were thought meet onelie
    for women in childbed. As for servants, if they had anie sheet above
    them it was well, for seldom had they anie under their bodies, to keep
    them from the pricking straws that ran oft through the canvas of the
    pallet and rased their hardened hides.</p>

  <p>The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of vessell, as of
    treene<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> platters into pewter, and wooden spoones into silver or
    tin. For so common were all sorts of treene stuffe in old time, that
    a man should hardlie find foure peeces of pewter (of which one was
    peradventure a salt) in a good farmer’s house and yet for all this
    frugalitie (if it may so be justly called) they were scarse able to
    live and paie their rents at their daies without selling of a cow,
    or an horsse, or more, although they paid but foure pounds at the
    uttermost by the year. Such also was their povertie that if some one od
    farmer or husbandman had beene at the alehouse a thing greatlie used
    in those daies, amongst six or seven of his neighbours, and there in
    a braverie to show what store he had, did cast downe his pursse, and
    therein a noble or six shillings in silver unto them (for few such men
    then cared for gold bicause it was not so readie paiment and they
    were oft inforced to give a penie for the exchange of an angell),
    it was verie likelie that all the rest could not laie downe so much
    against it; whereas in my time, although peradventure foure pounds of
    old rent be improved to fortie, fiftie, or an hundred pounds, yet will
    the farmer as another palme or date tree thinke his gaines verie small
    toward the end of his terme, if he have not six or seven yeares rent
    lieng by him, therewith to purchase a new lease, beside a faire garnish
    of pewter on his cupbord, with so much more in od vessel going about
    the house, three or foure featherbeds, so many counterlids and carpets
    of tapistrie, a silver salt, a bowle for wine (if not an whole neast)
    and a dozzen of spoones to furnish up the sute.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

  <p>Or, again, to take another contemporary authority (Hall, <i>Society in
      the Elizabethan Age</i>):—</p>

  <p>“The furniture of an Elizabethan House is illustrated by an inventory
    of the Household ‘stuffe, goodes and cattelles’ belonging to Sir Henry
    Parker knight (1557–60). This inventory shows two chairs only for
    the whole house; eight stools and forms; two square framed tables;
    one joined table to say mass on; a pair of ‘playing tables’; twelve
    bedsteads; tapestry and hangings; featherbeds; blankets; bolsters;
    testors; curtains; counterpoints (counterpanes); seven cupboards;
    three carpets; andirons, fire shovels, tongs; thirteen candlesticks;
    certain cushions of tapestry, velvet, white satin and ‘Brydges’ satin;
    three great chests; utensils for the kitchen; the Brewhouse and the
    Bargehouse. The Hall was hung round with tapestry; its permanent
    furniture consisted of two square tables and one great chair of black
    velvet in which the Justice of the Peace heard cases. When the tables
    were spread for dinner or supper, forms were brought in. The ‘Great
    Chamber,’ formerly called the Lady’s Bower, contained the forms used at
    meals in the Hall, one stool of black velvet for my Lady; and nothing
    else! In the bedrooms there were the beds and their blankets and
    nothing else; not a chair or a table; nothing but the bed—what does
    one want in a bedroom but the bed to sleep upon? For decorations one
    room had over the chimney a ‘steyned cloth with Marie and Gabriell.’
    Another had curtains of sarcenet; another, of red and green say;
    another, ‘old tapestrye worke of imagery.’ In one chamber we find a
    bason and ewer of pewter—was this the only means of washing in the
    whole house? In the buttery were a dozen of fine trenchers ‘cased’;
    six glasses; six plates for fruits; a ‘garnish’ of pewter vessels; two
    pewter plates for tarts. Nothing is said of knives—did each person
    still carry his own? Even then there must have been carving knives.
    Forks were not as yet in common use, and nothing is said about spoons.”</p>

  <p>The inventory of a farmer’s goods about the same time, given in the
    same work, shows among the household gear, two pewter dishes, three
    pewter platters, two saucers, four trencher platters, six trencher
    dishes, two brass kettles, two candlesticks and a chafing dish, eight
    bowls of wood, twelve trenchers, and twelve trencher spoons; but still
    nothing about knives. Nor in any of the numerous inventories and
    accounts given in this book is any mention made of knives. We see,
    however, in the tables laid upon trestles, the single chair, the forms
    and stools, the fine tapestry of the Hall, the carpets of the Great
    Chamber, the testers and the curtains of the bed which stands alone
    in the bedroom, a compound of state and simplicity; of meanness and
    richness. Furniture in the modern sense had not yet appeared in the
    house.</p>

  <p>To quote from Shakespeare, Gremio, in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, thus
    speaks of his furniture:—</p>

  <p>Or take the following note of a lady’s room:—</p>

  <p>“Her bed-chamber was garnished with such diversities of sweete herbes,
    such varietie of fragrant flowers, such chaunge of odoriferous smelles,
    so perfumed with sweete odours, so stored with sweete waters, so
    beautified with tapestry, and decked so artificially, that I want
    memorie to rehearse it, and cunning to expresse it, so that it seemed
    her Chamber was rather some terresstriall Paradise, than a mansion for
    such a matelesse mystresse; rather a tabernacle for some Goddesse, than
    a lodging for such a loathsome carcase.”</p>

  <p>The Tudor age was strong in small points of ceremony and etiquette,
    which descended even to details of housework. For instance, the
    ceremony to be observed in making the King’s Bed, a thing which we
    might suppose left to a housemaid, was carefully laid down:—</p>

  <p>“Furste a groome or a page to take a torche and to goo to the warderobe
    of the kynges bedd, and brynge theym of the warderobe with the kynges
    stuff unto the chambr for makyng of the same bedde. Where as sught to
    be a gentylman-usher iiij yeomen of the chambr for to make the same
    bedde. The groome to stande at the bedds feete with his torche. They
    of the warderobe opennyng the kinges stuff of hys bedde upon a fayre
    sheets betwen the sayde groome and the bedds fote, iij yeomen or two
    at the lefte in every syde of the bedde. The gentylman usher and parte
    commaundyng theym what they shall doo. A yoman with a dagger to searche

    the sayde bedde, and to laye oon then the bolster without touchyng
    of the bedd where as it aught to lye. Then they of the warderobe to

  <p>The wealth of the English was not so much illustrated, as it was
    proved, by their immense stores of silver and silver-gilt plate. The
    people bought all the plate that they could afford; they put their
    savings, so to speak, in silver plate, as we put them in stocks and
    shares. Polydore Vergil says that there were few whose tables were not
    loaded with spoons, cups, and salt-cellars of silver. At the marriage
    feast of Prince Arthur there was in the great hall a cupboard five
    stages in height, set with plate valued at £1200, say £15,000 of our
    money; while in the chamber where the Princess dined there was a
    cupboard of gold plate valued at £20,000 or £240,000 in our money.
    Cardinal Wolsey must have spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> enormous sums upon plate. There
    were two banqueting rooms, in each of which was a cupboard extended
    along the whole length of the apartment, piled to the top with plate,
    and every guest chamber was provided with silver ewers, basins, and
    candlesticks. Of silver spoons or dishes there were none; the dishes
    were of pewter and the plates of wood, even in the greatest houses.</p>

  <p>Lastly, on the subject of furniture, let me quote from another paper in
    <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxxvi. p. 284:—</p>

  <p>“The furniture of the hall is excessively scanty and plain, consisting
    of but a single table and two forms, of the total value of 4s. 6d. In
    the parlour, however, is a much greater abundance of furniture, as,
    in addition to the main table, there is the side table and another
    small table, a chair and six stools with embroidered cushions, besides
    footstools; while for the decoration of the room we find a portrait
    of Henry VIII. and hangings of green saye, and, for the amusement of
    the family and guests, a pair of virginals, a base lute, and a guitar,
    with chess and backgammon boards for those not musically inclined. The
    children’s chamber, or nursery as we should call it, is comfortably
    provided with bedding and nursery requisites, and contains a cupboard,
    two coffers, and a great wicker hamper, as receptacles for the clothes,
    etc. The allowance of blankets appears but small, being only one pair
    to a bed, either in the nursery or in the bedroom of the master of
    the house. The latter room is provided with a walnut-tree bedstead,
    adorned with green fringe, and having a coverlet of tapestry, a walnut
    table, chairs and stools, curtains for the windows of green saye,
    a warming-pan, and, as a ready means of defence against thieves or
    intruders, a pole-axe. In an inner closet, leading out of this room,
    are four stills, for the use of the lady of the house.</p>

  <p>Sir William More’s own closet is so well appointed that it might
    almost serve as a model for the morning-room of a country squire of
    the present day. On the walls hang maps of the World, of France, of
    England, and of Scotland, and a picture of Judith, a little chronicle,
    and a perpetual almanac in frames. Among the accessories are a globe, a
    slate to write on, and a counterboard and cast of counters, with which
    to make calculations and cast accounts, in the manner then in vogue. On
    the desk are a pair of scales and a set of weights, a pair of scissors,
    a penknife, a whetstone, a pair of compasses, a foot-rule, a hammer, a
    seal of many seals, and an inkstand of pewter, with a pounce-box, and
    pens both of bone and steel. Around the room is a collection of about
    120 volumes of books; among them are some of the best chronicles of the
    time, as Fabyan, Langton, Harding, Carion, etc.; translations from the
    classics, as well as some in their original language; for magisterial
    business there are the statutes of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary,
    and all the statutes before, as well as the <i>New Book of Justices</i>,
    and other legal works; for medical use we find a <i>Book of Physic</i>, the
    <i>Glass of Health</i>, and a book against the Sweat, as well as a <i>Book
      of Medicines for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span> Horses</i>; while for lighter reading there are such
    books as Chaucer, Lydgate, Skelton, and others, not only in English but
    also in French and Italian; and for religious study, besides a Bible
    and Testaments in various languages, the <i>Scala Perfectionis</i>, <i>Flores
      Bibliae</i>, etc. The whole catalogue is worthy of attentive perusal by
    the bibliographical antiquary, and affords the titles of some English
    works which are not, I believe, at present known.</p>

  <p>In the closet of the lady of the house are a few more books,
    principally of prayers, a large collection of trunks and boxes, a
    number of glass vessels of various forms and uses, and a few of enamel
    or china, with trenchers, knives, shears, graters, snuffers, moulds,
    brushes, and other miscellaneous properties of a good housewife.”</p>

  <p>Water was carried about the City from the conduits by water-carriers
    called “Cobbs,” who carried it in large tankards, each holding about
    three gallons.</p>

  <p>The palmy time of tobacco extended over the fifty years after its
    introduction. During this time the use of tobacco penetrated all ranks
    and classes of society. The grave divine, the soldier, the lawyer, the
    gallant about town, the merchant, the craftsman, the ’prentice, all
    used pipes. At the theatre the young fellow called for his pipe and for
    tobacco and began to smoke: presently he rose and walking over to the
    boxes presented his pipe to any lady of his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>People went to bed with tobacco box and pipe and candle on a table by
    the bedside in case they might wake up in the night and feel inclined
    for tobacco. After supper in a middle-class family, all the men and
    women smoked together. Nay, it is even stated that the very children
    in school took a pipe of tobacco instead of breakfast, the master
    smoking with them and instructing them how to bring the smoke through
    the nostrils in the fashion of the day. Tobacco was bought and sold in
    pennyworths.</p>

  <p>Every man carried a “tobacco box, steel, and touch.” Early in the
    seventeenth century there are said to have been 7000 tobacconists’
    shops in London. This seems incredible; perhaps there were 7000 shops
    in which tobacco was sold. For instance, all apothecaries sold tobacco.
    Many of the tobacco shops were of handsome appearance. A tobacco shop
    had a maple block for cutting the leaf; tongs for holding the coals,
    and a fire of juniper at which the pipes were lighted. Tobacco was
    so cheap that a man might fill his pocket with it for twopence. Yet
    over £300,000 a year was spent in London on tobacco, while there were
    some—but this is impossible—who were reported to spend, habitually,
    £400 a year upon tobacco alone; that is, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>,000 pocketsful every year,
    or 130 pocketsful every day; which is absurd.</p>

  <p>Expletives and oaths are changed with every generation. The
    Elizabethans had, no doubt, a great many, of which the following
    represent but a few. The old Catholic oaths “By’r Lady,” “By the
    Mass,” and so forth, vanished with the Reformation. We now find a lot
    of meaningless ejaculations, such as “God’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> Wounds,” “God’s Fools,”
    “God’s Dines,” “Cocke’s Bones,” “Deuce take me,” “Bones a God,”
    and “Bones a me.” The now familiar “Damn” makes its appearance in
    literature; but indeed it had flourished in the mouths of the people
    for many generations. There is nothing really remarkable about the
    swearing of the Elizabethan period.</p>

  <p>Every merchant formerly carried a signet-ring, on which was engraved,
    not his coat-of-arms, but his mark or signet. Thus, a curious
    signet-ring was found lying in the bed of the river while digging
    the foundations of London Bridge. At first it was believed to be Sir
    Thomas Gresham’s, but that seems now to be impossible. It is engraved
    in <i>The London and Middlesex Notebook</i> (p. 195). The device contains
    the initials of the owner, with an arrangement of lines probably not
    intended to have any meaning except that they should be recognised as
    forming part of Sir Thomas Gresham’s signet. Armed with this ring as an
    introduction, a messenger could buy and sell for the merchant—it being
    presumed that the ring never left its owner save to be used as a letter
    of recommendation and introduction. Sometimes the signet-ring was worn
    on the thumb. Other merchants’ devices are figured in the “Notebook.”</p>

  <p>Foreigners have revealed to us some very curious and rather startling
    peculiarities of the custom of kissing as practised by our ancestors.
    Thus as early as 1466 a Bohemian nobleman named Leo von Rozmital
    visited England, and in the Journal of his Travel (1577) it is noted
    that “it is the custom there, that on the arrival of a distinguished
    stranger from foreign parts, maids and matrons go to the inn and
    welcome him with gifts. Another custom is observed there, which is
    that, when guests arrive at an inn, the hostess with all her family go
    out to meet and receive them; and the guests are required to kiss them
    all, and this among the English was the same as shaking hands among
    other nations.” Erasmus, in 1499, wrote a Latin letter from England
    to his friend Fausto Anfrelini, an Italian poet, exhorting him in a
    strain of playful levity to think no more of his gout, but to betake
    himself to England; for (he remarks) “here are girls with angels’
    faces, so kind and obliging, that you would far prefer them to all
    your Muses. Besides, there is a custom here never to be sufficiently
    recommended. Wherever you come you are received with a kiss by all;
    when you take your leave you are dismissed with kisses; you return,
    kisses are repeated. They come to visit you, kisses again; they leave
    you, you kiss them all round. Should they meet you anywhere, kisses in
    abundance; in fine, wherever you move, there is nothing but kisses.” In
    1527 Cardinal Wolsey was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary to France.
    He was accompanied by George Cavendish, his gentleman usher, who wrote
    a Life of the Cardinal. Cavendish had gone forward to prepare his
    lord’s lodging. He says: “And I being there (at the Sire de Créqui’s
    Castle at Moreuil, about twelve miles from Amiens) tarrying a while, my
    lady Créqui<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span> issued out of her chamber into her dining chamber, where I
    attended her coming, who received me very gently like her noble estate,
    having a traine of twelve gentlewomen. And when she and her traine was
    come all out, she saide unto me, ‘For as much,’ quoth she, ‘as ye be an
    Englishman whose custome is to kisse all ladies and gentlemen in your
    country without offense, although it is not soe here with us in this
    realme, yet I will be so bould as kisse you, and soe ye shall doe all
    my maids.’ By meanes whereof I kissed her and all her maides.” In the
    narrative of the visit of the Spanish nobleman, the Duke de Najera,
    in 1543–44, we are told that “after the dancing was finished (which
    lasted several hours) the Queen entred again into her chamber, having
    previously called one of the noblemen who spoke Spanish, to offer in
    her name, some presents to the Duke, who again kissed her hand; and on
    his requesting the same favour of the Princess Mary, she would by no
    means permit it, but offered him her lips, and the Duke saluted her,
    and did the same to all the other ladies.” A Greek traveller, Nicander
    Nucius, came to England in 1545, and remarks: “They display great
    simplicity and absence of jealousy in their usages towards females. For
    not only do those who are of the same family and household kiss them on
    the mouth with salutations and embraces, but even those too who have
    never seen them. And to themselves this appears by no means indecent.”
    Again, when the Constable of Castile appeared at the Court of Whitehall
    on Saturday afternoon, 18th August 1604, after kissing Her Majesty’s
    hands he requested permission to salute the ladies of honour (twenty in
    number, standing in a row, and beautiful exceedingly) according to the
    custom of the country, and any neglect of which is taken as an affront.
    Whereupon the Queen having given him leave, His Excellency complied
    with the custom, much to the satisfaction of the ladies.</p>

  <p>In Shakespeare’s <i>Henry VIII.</i>, at the Cardinal’s banquet, the King
    says to Anne Bullen:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i20">“Sweetheart,</div>
        <div class="i0">I were unmannerly, to take you out,</div>
        <div class="i0">And not to kiss you.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In dancing it appears to have been the customary fee of a lady’s
    partner. A further illustration of the custom may be seen. Foreigners
    of the male sex, and especially Frenchmen, are in the more frequent
    habit of kissing each other, and probably not the ladies. Misson, a
    Frenchman who travelled in England about 1697, says: “The people of
    England, when they meet, never salute one another, otherwise than by
    giving one another their hands, and shaking them heartily; they no more
    dream of pulling off their hats, than the women do of pulling off their
    headcloths.”</p>

  <p>The sin of great cities we may pass over; that of early marriage is
    still, as it was in Stubbes’ time, a very terrible evil; the sin of
    drunkenness is with us still, and is present in every country. The
    side of charity that consists in giving doles to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> poor was then
    neglected, and is now destroyed. We still suffer from money-lenders,
    though they can no longer conduct us to a life-long prison.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Beleeve mee,” says Stubbes, “it greeveth mee to heare (walking in
      the streats) the pitiful cryes, and miserable complaints of poore
      prisoners in durance for debt, and like so to continue all their
      life, destitute of libertie, meat, drink (though of the meanest
      sorte), and clothing to their backs, lying in filthie strawe, and
      lothsome dung, wursse than anie dogge, voide of all charitable
      consolation and brotherly comfort in this World, wishing and
      thyrsting after death to set them at libertie, and loose them from
      their shackles, giues, and yron bands.” (Stubbes.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As for the boys of this century, I have always thought their favourite
    haunt was the river, or the river-side. On the river they rowed about
    among the fishermen, and the swans above Bridge; the Queen’s Barge
    swept past them with its trumpets and its hangings gorgeous to behold;
    the Lord Mayor and the Companies were borne along before them in state
    and splendour such as we have forgotten—surely nothing could have been
    more splendid than these barges with their long lines of flashing oars
    and their bows gilt and carved, and the carved work of the covered
    seat of state, and the servants in their green and gold. Below Bridge,
    in the Port, they rowed in and out among the ships as boys will about
    Portsmouth Harbour now; the name of each ship with her port was written
    on her lofty stern. The figure-head of each was bright as paint and
    gold would make it. If they were allowed to go on board there were
    sailors full of yarns, with strange things to show as well as to tell.
    If they went as far down as Deptford, there was Drake’s ship, the ship
    which had gone all round the world—all round the world! If they stayed
    ashore, there were taverns in Wapping and St. Katherine’s, where they
    could snatch the fearful joy of seeing the sailors drink and fight, the
    foreign sailors and the English sailors, and the sailors from the North
    Country, and those of London and the Cinque Ports. The river and the
    river-side were famous schools to fill the minds of London boys with an
    ardour for adventure; a yearning for the way of war; a burning desire
    to cross the seas and visit far countries; and a thirst for geography;
    and all the London boys of every class regularly attended the classes
    of this Academy.</p>

  <p>The theatre, of course, offers a fine field for the Elizabethan
    satirist, Stubbes. He cannot find words strong enough to condemn the
    playgoer. Then there is that other source and fount of laughter, the
    Lord of Misrule.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“First, all the wilde-heds of the Parish, conuenting togither,
      chuse them a Graund Captain (of all mischeefe) whome they innoble
      with the title of ‘my Lord of Mis-rule,’ and him they crowne with
      great solemnitie, and adopt for their King. This king anointed
      chuseth forth twentie, fortie, threescore or a hundred lustie
      Guttes, like to himself, to waighte vppon his lordly Maiestie, and
      to guarde his noble person. Then, euerie one of these his men,
      he inuesteth with his liuerues of green, yellow, or some other
      light wanton colour; And as though that were not baudie (gaudie)
      enough, I should say, they bedecke them selues with scarfs,
      ribons, and laces hanged all over with golde rings, precious
      stones, and other jewels: this doon, they tye about either leg
      xx. or xl. bels, with rich handkerchiefs in their hands, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
      sometimes laid a crosse ouer their shoulders and necks, borrowed
      for the most parte of their pretie Mopsies and loouing Besses,
      for bussing them in the dark. Thus al things set in order, then
      haue they their Hobby-horses, dragons and other antiques, togither
      with their baudie Pipers and thundering Drummers to strike vp
      the deuils daunce withall. Then marche these heathen company
      towards the church and Churchyard, their pipers pipeing, their
      drummers thundring, their stumps dauncing, their bels iyngling,
      their handkerchiefs swinging about their heds like madmen, their
      hobbie horses and other monsters skirmishing amongst the route:
      and in this sorte they go to the Church (I say) and into the
      Church (though the Minister be at prair or preaching), dancing and
      swinging their handkerchiefs ouer their heds in the Church, like
      deuils incarnate, with such a confuse noise, that no man can hear
      his own voice. Then, the foolish people they looke, they stare,
      they laugh, they fleer, and mount vpon fourmes and pewes to see
      these goodly pageants solemnized in this sort. Then, after this,
      about the Church they goe againe and againe, and so foorth into the
      churchyard, where they haue commonly their Sommer-haules, their
      bowers, arbors, and banqueting houses set vp, wherin they feast,
      banquet and daunce al that day and (peradventure) all the night
      too. And thus these terrestriall furies spend the Sabaoth day.”

  <p>The custom of church ales is described by Stubbes with his customary
    vigour:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In certaine Townes where drunken <i>Bachus</i> beares all the sway,
      against a Christmas, an Easter, Whitsonday, or some other time,
      the Church-wardens (for so they call them) of euery parish, with
      the consent of the whole Parish, prouide half a score of twenty
      quarters of mault, wherof some they buy of the Church-stock, and
      some is giuen them of the Parishioners them selves, euery one
      conferring somewhat, according to his abilitie; which mault, beeing
      made into very strong ale or beere, it is set to sale, either in
      the Church, or some other place assigned to that purpose.</p>

    <p>Then, when the <i>Nippitatum</i>, this Huf-cap (as they call it) and
      this <i>nectar</i> of lyfe, is set abroche, wel is he that can get
      the soonest to it, and spend the most at it; for he that fitteth
      the closest to it, and spends the moste at it, he is counted the
      godliest man of all the rest; but who either cannot, for pinching
      pouertie, or otherwise, wil not stick to it, he is counted one
      destitute bothe of vertue and godlynes. In so much as you shall
      haue many poor men make hard shift for money to spend ther at,
      for it beeing put into this <i>Corban</i>, they are perswaded it is
      meritorious, and a good seruice to God. In this kinde of practise
      they continue six weeks, a quarter of a year, yea, half a year
      togither, swilling and gulling, night and day, till they be as
      drunke as Apes, and as blockish as beasts.” (Stubbes, <i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They pretend, he says, to repair their churches with money so got:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“But who seeth not that they bestow this money vpon nothing lesse
      than in building and repayring of Churches and Oratories? For in
      most places lye they not like swyn coates? their windowes rent,
      their dores broken, their walles fall downe, the roofe all bare,
      and what not out of order? Who seeth not the booke of God, rent,
      ragged, and all betorn, couered in dust, so as this <i>Epitaphe</i> may
      be writ with ones finger vppon it, <i lang="la">ecce nunc in puluere dormio</i>?
      (Alas;) behold I sleep in dust and oblyuion, not once scarse looked
      vppon, much less red vpon, and the least of all preached vppon.”
      (Stubbes, <i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of wakes and feasts and “the horrible vice of pestiferous dancing” we
    need say little. Nor of music, “how it allureth to vanitie”; nor of
    cards, dice, tennis, and bowls, all of which we still practise; nor of
    the bear-baiting which we have now discontinued. Of the reading of bad
    books we may still complain after the manner of Stubbes. In a word, his
    <i>Book of Lamentations</i> would serve with slight alterations for to-day
    as well as his own age.</p>

  <p>On the exchange of English goods for foreign trifles, I find a note in
    Furnivall’s edition of Stubbes’ <i>Anatomy</i>:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">

        <div class="i0">As bugles to make bables, coloured bones, glass beads to make bracelets withal,</div>
        <div class="i0">For every day gentlewomen of England do ask for such trifles from stall to stall:</div>
        <div class="i0">And you must bring more, as amber, jet, coral, crystal, and every such bable</div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>
  <p>The suppressing of the Religious Houses produced, for a time, a great
    deal of hardship and difficulty. For not only were the friars turned
    out into the streets, but all the people living upon the monasteries
    were deprived of their daily bread; many of these unfortunates took
    to the road and became tramps, vagabonds, masterless men and thieves;
    many took refuge in those parts of London which were outside the
    jurisdiction of the City. London, indeed, was the place which the
    masterless man regarded as a veritable Paradise. They flocked up to
    London from all quarters; they were constantly being turned out and as
    constantly coming back again. When Queen Elizabeth once drove out to
    the country cottage of Islington, she was mobbed by a gang of vagabonds
    who accosted her with clamours; they harboured in the brick kilns
    there. In some parts close to London, as Hyde Park Corner and Lincoln’s
    Inn Fields, no one would venture after dark. Men took arms into their
    bedrooms at night, ready for use. Generally it seems that they hung
    a drawn sword at the bedside. The ’prentices, however, were the best
    protectors to a house. They slept in the shop, if there were a shop;
    or if there were no shop they slept somewhere on the ground floor, as
    is evident from the edifying revelations of “Meriton Latron,” in which
    it is shown how easily the ’prentices could get out at night for these
    riotous and profligate meetings and drinkings. I suppose it matters
    nothing that this writer belongs to the next century. In such small
    matters the world is conservative. According to this authority, it was
    common for ’prentices to rob their masters, exchanging with each other
    or holding a kind of auction in their taverns at night. The time when
    the City was most free from crimes was when the men had been called out
    to follow the flag and fight. The worst time was after the war, when
    they all came back again to their old haunts, thirsting for their old
    amusements and more disinclined for work than ever.</p>

      <span class="subhead">FOOD AND DRINK</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> manner and times of taking food under the Tudors may be summed up
    as follows:—</p>

  <p>For breakfast, those who made a meal before dinner at all, took,
    in the country, pottage, and, in town, “muskadel and eggs,” or
    bread-and-butter with a draught of small ale. The Princess Mary, in
    1533, used to eat so much meat for breakfast that she terrified her
    physicians. It does not appear, however, that the workpeople took
    anything at all unless it were a draught of small ale before their
    dinner at ten. The hour of dinner varied during the century from ten
    till twelve. For children there was “nuntion” or luncheon before dinner
    and a “bever” or slight repast between dinner and supper. Venner
    recommends no breakfast at all, but to wait for dinner. If, however,
    one cannot wait, then he advises poached eggs, with salt, pepper,
    a little vinegar, bread-and-butter and claret. When Cosmo, Duke of
    Tuscany, came to the country he visited Colonel John Nevill, and had
    breakfast with him, drinking Italian wine.</p>

  <p>The dinners were plentiful and varied. A salad was served first, then
    the beef and mutton; next fowls, and fish; game followed, woodcock
    being the most plentiful; and pastry and sweets came last. Honey was
    poured over the meat. The most important part of the meal, however, was
    the “banquet” or dessert which followed: at this part of the dinner an
    amazing quantity of sweetmeats was taken; for this every one adjourned
    to another room in winter; to the garden in summer.</p>

  <p>In the winter fresh meat was not always to be had: most people laid in
    large quantities of beef in October and November, which they salted.
    The markets, however, made up for the absence of fresh meat by the
    abundance of all kinds of birds which were brought into London; they
    were trapped, or shot with sling and stone, in the marshes along the
    lower reaches of the Thames. Pork could be had all the year round.
    Fresh fish was generally plentiful, but it was sometimes dear. At such
    times the people fell back upon stockfish, which was often bad and
    the cause of much disease. Herrings were brought by sea from Yarmouth
    in barrels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> and partly salted, as they are at this day. They were a
    favourite form of food, and were made into pasties highly spiced.</p>

  <p>The food of the sixteenth century was more stimulating than our own:
    the only drink was fermented and alcoholic, even the small beer which
    was the national beverage; there was no tea or coffee; vast quantities
    of wine were taken; there were nearly a hundred different kinds, more
    than half being French. Wine of Bordeaux was sold at 8d. the gallon;
    Spanish wine at 1s. In drinking sack, the cup was half filled with
    sugar. Indeed, sugar or honey was taken with everything: with roast
    meat, with wine, and in the form of sweetmeats; so that the teeth of
    most people were black in consequence.</p>

  <p>A diet so stimulating could not fail to produce its effects in causing
    the people to be more easily moved to wrath, to love, to pity, to
    jealousy—than a diet composed of tea and coffee. There can be no doubt
    whatever that all classes of men and women were far readier with hand
    and tongue than at present; swifter to wrath; more prone to sudden
    outbursts; more quick with dagger or sword.</p>

  <p>Their tables were set out on trestles for the dinner and removed after
    dinner. People sat on stools; the floor was strewn with rushes; the
    tables, not the floors, were covered with rich carpets.</p>

  <p>A piece of the table furniture which has long since disappeared was
    the Roundel. It is supposed to have been used for fruit. A set of
    Roundels, not quite perfect, is described in <i>Archæologia</i> (vol.
    xxxix.). They are circular and of wood, the upper side perfectly plain;
    the lower side is partly covered with black paint or dye and partly
    white. A legend, in rhyme, runs round the outer edge, and within is a
    figure with a number. The figure and letters are gilt. In this example
    nine trenchers out of the twelve represent the Courtier, the Country
    gentleman, the Lawyer, and so forth—characters of the time, the verses
    being taken from a book called <i>The XII. Wonders of the World</i>.</p>

  <p>It is pleasing to learn from Harrison of the reform introduced in his
    own time by the revival of the custom of taking vegetables of all kinds
    and plentifully. He says:—</p>

  <p>“Such herbes, fruits, and roots also as grow yeerlie out of the ground,
    of seed, have been verie plentifull in this land, in the time of the
    first Edward, and after his daies; but in processe of time they grew
    also to be neglected, so that from Henrie the fourth till the latter
    end of Henrie the seventh, and beginning of Henrie the eight, there was
    little or no use of them in England, but they remained either unknowne,
    or supposed as food more meet for hogs and savage beasts to feed upon
    than mankind. Whereas in my time their use is not onlie resumed among
    the poore commons, I mean of melons, pompions, gourds, cucumbers,
    radishes, skirets, parsneps, carrets, cabbages, nauewes, turneps, and
    all kinds of salad herbs, but also fed upon as deintie dishes at the
    tables of delicate merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> gentlemen, and the nobilitie, who make
    their provision yearlie for new seeds out of strange countries, from
    whence they have them aboundantlie.” (Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles</i>.)</p>

  <p>The Flemings commenced the first market-gardens. Lettuce was served as
    a separate dish, and eaten at supper before meat. Capers were usually
    eaten boiled with oil and vinegar, as a salad. Eschalots were used to
    smear the plate before putting meat on it. Carrots had been introduced
    by the Flemings. Rhubarb, then called Patience, came from China about
    1573. The common people ate turnip-leaves as a salad, and roasted the
    root in wood-ashes. Watercress was believed to restore the bloom to
    young ladies’ cheeks.</p>

  <p>They used mustard and horse-radish; they took anchovies with wine;
    they took olives with wine; they had boiled oysters; boiled radishes,
    artichokes raw or boiled; they poured honey or spread sugar over their
    beef and mutton; they served pork in many ways, but if roasted, then
    with green sauce of sorrel; salmon they stuck with cloves; they ate
    porpoises; turkeys were roasted with cloves; peacocks they roasted
    while they were still under a year old; pigeons they stuffed with sour
    grapes or unripe gooseberries; rabbits were cheap and plentiful; pies
    of all kinds were very popular. They made salad out of barberries in
    pickle or with lettuces as in modern fashion. In the ordinaries and
    taverns there were no wine-glasses: people drank out of green pots made
    of white clay. They took supper at six; this was a smaller meal than
    dinner, but yet a plentiful meal. In a word, the Elizabethan Englishman
    lived much as the modern Frenchman lives: he took two meals a day and
    no more. In the principal ordinaries and inns musicians attended; even
    in the cheaper ones a viol de gamba was kept for everybody who could
    play; men dined for choice at the ordinary, which was a great deal
    cheaper than the tavern; it was not customary for the ladies to appear
    at taverns. An inn was known by its painted lattice; all kinds of
    wine could be had at most taverns, but foreign wines were sold to the
    general public by apothecaries. Waiters wore aprons. In private houses,
    but not at ordinaries and taverns, the silver fork had been introduced.</p>

    the seventeenth century without any mention of forks. I am inclined,
    therefore, to believe that they came into use very slowly, and that
    the old fashion of eating with a knife, fingers, and bread, lasted in
    country houses at least until the end of the seventeenth century. It
    is a survival of the old manner of eating which makes the lower class
    “eat with their knives.” Let me add that in my own recollection the
    practice has almost entirely disappeared. Forty years ago one could not
    take dinner at a tavern or an eating-house without seeing some of the
    company helping themselves with their knives.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately these bills never contain the whole. It is of course

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The greatest attention was paid to the service of the table: not only,
    for instance, must the carving be performed in manner peculiar to each
    kind of creature, but each creature had its own verb signifying its
    carving. The terms used for carving are curious and now completely
    forgotten:—</p>

  <p>“Breke that deer; lesche that brawn; rere that goose; lyfte that
    swanne; sauce that capon; spoil that hen; fruche that chekyn; unbrace
    that mallard; unlace that conye; desmembre that heron; display that

    ele; traunche that sturgeon; under-traunch that porpus; tayme that
    crabbe; barbe that lobster. Here endeth the goodlye termes of kervynge.”</p>

  <p>The way in which the table was to be served was presented, in general
    terms, as follows:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Slow be the servers in serving, alwaye,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">And next in minute detail. Thus including the reception of a guest. Let
    us first remember that the plates were commonly of bread, but sometimes
    of wood. When they were of bread, the loaves were first carefully
    pared; then the butler placed the salt-cellar before the principal
    guest, and in front of the salt-cellar, upon the carving knives, he
    was to place the bread. But before Grace this was to be removed, and
    replaced in thick slices one upon the other.</p>

  <p>After the dinner was eaten what remained was taken down for the
    servants, and whatever was left over when these had finished was
    bestowed upon the poor who sat outside the doors waiting their turn.
    The drink was served in silver cups and bowls, or else in goblets of
    Venetian glass from Murano; the poorer sort had pots of earthenware
    bound or set in silver and perhaps pewter. As a rule not more than two
    or three dishes were served at a gentleman’s table where there was no
    company. This, however, was not the case when a feast was provided,
    or by the merchants for themselves. Then such meat as is killed and
    provided by the butcher was rejected as not worthy of the occasion.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In such cases also geliffes of all colours mixed with a varietie
      in the representation of sundrie floures, herbs, trees, formes of
      beasts, fish, foules, and fruits, and thereunto marchpaine wrought
      with no small curiositie, tarts of diverse hewes and sundrie
      denominations, conserves of old fruites forren and home bred,
      suckets, codinacs, marmilats, marchpaine, sugerbread, gingerbread,

      Plinie calleth Mel ex arundinibus, a devise not common nor greatlie
      used in old time at the table, but onlie in medicine, although
      it grew in Arabia, India and Sicilia), doo generally beare the

  <p>Every kind of wine was served at these banquets, <i>e.g.</i> the fifty-six
    various kinds of “small wines” as Claret, White, Red, French, etc.;
    but also of the thirty kinds of Italian, German, Spanish, Canary, etc.
    And besides these here were the artificial drinks such as Hypocras and
    Wormwood wine, besides ale and beer.</p>

  <p>The craftsman lived in great plenty: his diet was commonly beef,
    mutton, veal and pork; besides which he had brawn, bacon, pies of
    fruit, fowls, cheese, butter and eggs. At weddings, purifications,
    and so forth, the friends contributed each a dish of some kind, and
    the feasting that went on was incredible. At table the custom among
    the gentry and better sort was to observe great silence during the
    dinner, and on no account to show any sign of being the worse for the
    wine they had taken. Enough grain was grown in the country to supply
    it with bread; a good deal of bread was made of oats and rye; in times
    of dearth beans, peas, and lentils were ground up. Of home-made drinks
    besides ale and beer there were cider, perry, and, especially among the
    Welsh, mead or metheglin.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“There is a kind of swish swash made also in Essex, and diverse
      other places, with honicombs and water, which the homelie countrie
      wives, putting some pepper and a little other spice among, call
      mead, verie good in mine opinion for such as love to be loose
      bodied at large, or a little eased of the cough, otherwise it
      differeth so much from the true metheglin, as chalke from cheese.
      Truelie it is nothing else but the washing of the combes, when
      the honie is wroong out, and one of the best things that I know
      belonging thereto is, that they spend but little labour and lesse
      cost in making of the same, and therefore no great losse if it were
      never occupied.” (Holinshed, vol. i. p. 170.)</p>

  <p>An oyster feast in the morning seems unusual and unexpected in a town
    of working men. We may read, however, how, on 30th July 1557, a company
    of citizens met in the cellar of Master Smyth and Master Gytton in
    Amber Lane, at eight o’clock in the morning. They devoured between
    them half a bushel of oysters, sitting upon hogsheads by candlelight;
    the oysters were accompanied by onions—was there no bread, or
    bread-and-butter? Only onions? And they drank with their oysters and
    onions copious bowls of red ale, claret, muscadel, and malmsey. It
    hardly seems a good beginning of the day so far as concerns work. In
    these degenerate days a repast of oysters and onions, with ale and
    muscadel, claret and malmsey, would prove a fatal feast indeed.</p>

  <p>Here is a note on an Elizabethan ordinary:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It seemed that all who came thither had clocks in their bellies,
      for they all strucke into the dyning-roome much at aboute the
      very minute of feeding. Our traveller had all the eyes (that
      came in) throwne upon him (as being a stranger), and he as much
      tooke especiall notice of them. In obseruing of whom and of the
      place, he found that an ordinary was the onely Rendeuouz for the
      most ingenious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> most terse, most trauaild and most phantastick
      gallant: the very Exchange for newes out of all countries; the
      only booke-sellers’ shop for conference of the best editions,
      that if a woman (to be a Lady) would cast away herselfe upon a
      knight, there a man should heare a catalogue of most of the richest
      London widowes; and last that it was a schoole where they were all
      fellowes of one forme, and that a country gentleman was of as great
      comming as the proudest justice that sat there on the bench aboue
      him; for hee that had the graine of the table with his bencher payd
      no more then he that placed himselfe beneath the salt.</p>

    <p>The bolder hauing cleered the table, cardes and dice are served
      up to the boord; they that are full of coyne draw; they that haue
      little stand by and give ayme; the shuffle and cut on one side,
      the bones rattle on the other; long have they not plaide, but
      oathes fly up and downe the roome like haile-shot; if the poore
      dumb dice be but a little out of the square line of white, the
      pox and a thousand plagues breake their neckes out at a window.”
      (<i>Antiquary</i>, vol. xv.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following is contemporary evidence. It is taken from the
    <i>Antiquarian Repertory</i> (vol. iv. p. 512), 1558:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The people of London consume great quantities of beer, double and
      single [strong and small], and do not drink it out of glasses, but
      from earthen pots with silver handles and covers, and this even in
      houses of persons of middling fortunes; for as to the poor, the
      covers of their pots are only pewter, and in some places, such as
      villages, their pots for beer are made only of wood.</p>

    <p>They eat much whiter bread than that commonly made in France,
      altho’ it was in my time as cheap as it is sold there. With their
      beer they have a custom of eating very soft saffron cakes, in which
      there are likewise raisins, which give a relish to the beer, of
      which there was formerly at Rye some as good as I ever drank. The
      houses of the people of this country are as well furnished as any
      in the world. Likewise, in this country you will scarcely find any
      nobleman, some of whose relations have not been beheaded.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A few more notes on food. They drank brewis, that is, the pot liquor
    with bread in it; they were fond of pigs’ faces washed and dressed
    by the housewife; they bought tripe in Eastcheap, and poultry in
    Gracechurch Street; they drank wines with strange names: Pedro Ximenes,
    Charnico, Eleatica. The clerks took their dinner at the cooks’ shops
    by messes of so many; the portion of the whole mess was served in a
    dish and one divided the food, after which they helped themselves by
    seniority; a yeoman’s fare was bread, beef, and beer. The poor man was
    served from the basket which stood in the hall and received broken
    meats. The Sheriffs sent such baskets and other food to the prisons.
    The citizens’ proverbial Sunday dinner was neck of beef.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Elizabethan age, the poet, satirists, and preachers are so
    full of the subject of feminine fashions that it becomes of great
    importance. The increase of wealth and the growing power of the middle
    class give a greater prominence to women’s dress, while the improvement
    in the streets and the roads, the introduction of coaches and the
    development of outdoor amusements, theatres, shows, masques, gardens,
    and water-parties bring the wives and daughters of London more into the
    open.</p>

      From Planché’s <i>Cyclopædia of Costume</i>.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It was a time of great expenditure upon clothes; the fashions were rich
    and costly; the custom was to make what we should call an ostentatious
    display of wealth. Ben Jonson and the dramatists are full of the
    extravagance of City madams. Not only did the ladies wear rich dresses;
    they prided themselves upon possessing a great number—as many as they
    could afford; in every house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> there was a room called the Wardrobe, in
    which the clothes of the household were hung up and carefully watched
    and kept from moth and decay.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of her reign the Queen, who set the fashion, wore a
    small ruff, with a kerchief about her neck; a kind of coat of black
    velvet and ermine fastened at the throat only; with a waistcoat and
    kirtle below of white silk or silver embroidered with black; on the
    shoulders were humps, and the sleeves were large. Stubbes abuses the
    fashion because it is “proper only to a man, yet they blush not to
    wear it.” The cap or coif was adorned with strings of pearls. Lawn and
    cambric ruffs came in shortly after Elizabeth’s accession. A Flemish
    woman named Van der Plasse came over and set up as a starcher of ruffs.
    The mere mention of starch made Stubbes furiously angry; the ruff was a
    “master devil”; the devil himself invented starch.</p>

  <p>The custom of wearing whalebone to imprison the figure down to the hips
    also began early in the reign; a long stomacher descended in front, and
    from the hips stood out the farthingale, horizontally; a hideous thing
    which was perpetuated in the hoop for two hundred years. As for the
    gowns they were made, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> indignation of the satirist, “of silk,
    of velvet, of grograin, of taffata, and of fine cloth, ten, twenty,
    or forty shillings a yard”; they were decorated with lace two fingers
    broad, or with velvet edged with lace. The petticoats were also of the
    finest stuff, fringed with silk, and in addition, they had a kirtle
    also of fine stuff and fringed with lace and silk. It appears therefore
    that they had first a gown which was pulled back and showed the kirtle,
    which itself was pulled back and disclosed the petticoat.</p>

  <p>Their stockings were made of the finest cloth, yarn, or worsted; silk
    stockings were presented to the Queen in her third year; knitted
    worsted stockings were introduced from Italy; the stockings of the fine
    ladies were “curiously indented in every point with quicks, clocks, and
    open seams.” They wore cork shoes made, like the petticoats and kirtle,
    of anything that was costly and rare and could be embroidered.</p>

  <p>The fashions of wearing the hair were endless. It was curled in
    innumerable curls; it was crisped; it was built up over a cushion; it
    was laid out over the forehead; it was ornamented with jewels, gold,
    wreaths of silver and gold, and kept in place with hairpins; the women
    wore over their hair French hoods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> hats, and caps; they wore cauls
    made of net-wire and cloth of gold and tinsel; they wore “lattice” caps
    with horns; and every merchant’s wife or mean gentlewoman indulged in
    these extravagant fashions.</p>

        <div class="i16">“You wore</div>

        <div class="i0">Headed with a pearl worth threepence.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It was a common practice to entice little children into private places
    and unfrequented courts there to cut off their long hair to be made up
    into false hair for women. Long and beautiful hair was in great request
    by the fashionable dames of the time. Brides especially went to the
    altar with flowing locks, the longer the better.</p>

  <div class="center-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a word, the Elizabethan fine lady was very fine indeed; much more
    artificial than her grandmother, and much less beautiful therefore.
    She painted her face; she dyed her hair, sometimes changing the colour
    from time to time, a practice which explains the different colour
    of the hair in Queen Mary’s portraits. She used perfumes copiously;
    she carried a large feather fan with a costly handle of silver or
    ivory. She also carried a mirror hanging from her girdle with which to
    contemplate the thing she loved best—her own face, made up, painted,
    and set in the frame of ruff and cap; strings of pearls were round
    the cap and a gold chain round the throat. And she frequented, but
    secretly, the wise women—there were scores of them in the city—who
    knew secrets ineffable—secrets that were like magic; perhaps they
    were magic—for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> improvement and preservation of the complexion,
    the brightness of the eyes, the gloss of the hair, the softness and
    smoothness of the arm and the throat, and everything that was open to
    the gaze of man. Ben Jonson preserves as in a phonograph the words and
    voice of the wise woman.</p>

  <p>The stuffs worn by gentlemen were taffeta; mockado—an inferior velvet;
    grogram—a cheaper taffeta; quellio for the ruff; tamin; sendall; and
    many others which are now mere words. The poorer women, not to be
    outdone more than was necessary, bought the same clothes, made in the
    same style, of the fripperer, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> broker, who dealt in second-hand
    clothes. Now the great danger of buying second-hand clothes was that
    you might at the same time buy the plague.</p>

  <p>Men were never so affected and so splendid in their dress as in the
    sixteenth century. They wore earrings; they wore costly brooches in
    their hats; the great nobles wore strings of pearls; they had thumb
    rings; they carried jewelled daggers; they carried a case of toothpicks
    with them; they carried their own napkins to the taverns; they had a
    favourite lock of hair, which they curled and treated tenderly, tying a
    rose to it or a bunch of ribbons; they wore their hair and their beards
    in fantastic ways, either after the French, Italian, or Spanish manner.
    As for the younger men, they played the usual tricks. That is to say,
    they tried to make the waist small; they wore “grulled calves”; they
    “bleached their hands at midnight, gumming and triding their beards.”
    Sleeves were slashed; girdles were hung with mirrors; the head was set
    in a ruff; high-heeled shoes raised the stature; men’s cloaks were of
    velvet trimmed with lace; buttons, buckles, and clasps were of gold;
    the hats were adorned with feathers.</p>

  <p>Tavern life in the time of the Tudors was picturesque and pleasant.
    The taverns were frequented not only by gallants and merchants, but
    by ladies. Suppers, it is true, were given to bona robas; the viol de
    gamba played for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> companies not always the most respectable; but there

  <p>The City Trained Bands were gorgeous in white doublets, with the City
    arms before and behind; the men-servants wore gorgeous liveries. Dress
    to a certain extent indicated class. Law and Divinity wore black.
    Furred gowns and satin sleeves marked the Sheriff or the Alderman. The
    plain citizen wore a cloak of brown or chocolate colour; the craftsman
    wore a doublet of cloth, or leather, with a leather belt, and in winter
    an overcoat down to the knees or the ankles. The following is the
    description of a runaway page:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“One doblet of yelow million fustian, th’one halfe therof buttoned

  <p>’Prentices wore a dress very much like that of the Blue Coat Boys,
    but with a flat cap. A citizen’s servant wore a blue livery. Knots of
    ribbons were tied on the shoes. The women gathered round the conduit
    and the bakehouse for gossip. The tradesmen issued their own tokens
    which passed current. Girls who served in the shops were taken on
    Sundays by their sweethearts to Islington or Pimlico. Shops were
    furnished with cudgels for the use of ’prentices in case of a fight.
    The cudgels were called by various endearing names, but the favourite
    name was a “Plymouth Cloak.” Clothes were washed at the riverside on
    wood or a flat stone. The love of fine dress is charged as a fault of
    the fair Londoners. Why they should be blamed for desiring what all
    men desire, viz. the appearance of bravery and splendour, is hard to
    understand. The sumptuary laws which were passed from time to time
    appear to have been intended not so much to prevent the gratification
    of this instinctive desire as to make different classes proclaim their
    rank and station by their dress. A tradesman, in fact, must not appear
    as a gentleman; nor a craftsman as a master. In a word, there was a
    constant feeling that rank should be indicated by outward apparel, and
    that every one should proclaim his station by his garments. Thus the
    Act of 1464 ordered</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That none below the dignity of a lord or knight of the garter, or
      their wives, should be allowed to wear purple, or any manner of
      cloth of gold, velvet or sable furs, under a penalty of 20 marks.
      That none below knights, bachelors, mayors, and aldermen, and their
      wives, should wear satin or ermine, under a penalty of 10 marks.
      That none but such as had possessions to the amount of 40s. per
      annum should be permitted to wear fustian, bustian, or scarlet
      cloth, and no fur, but black or white lamb, on forfeiture of 40s.</p>

    <p>That no yeoman, nor any under that degree, should be allowed to
      stuff or bolster their doublets, to wear short cloaks or jackets,
      or shoes with pikes passing the length of eleven inches, under a
      penalty of 20s.</p>

    <p>That no husbandman should use broad cloth at above 11s. a yard, nor
      hose above 14d. a pair: nor their wives kerchiefs whereof the price
      should exceed 12d. nor girdles harnessed with silver, upon pain of
      forfeiting at every default 40d.</p>

    <p>And because foreign kerchiefs were brought into the country, and
      sold at such extravagant prices, it was ordained that any one
      selling lawne, nyfell, umple, or other manner of kerchief whereof
      the price should exceed 10s. the seller should forfeit a mark for
      every one that he sold above that price.”</p>

  <p>To those who take the worthy Philip Stubbes quite seriously and
    literally, the Elizabethan age will appear more than commonly wicked
    and unscrupulous; to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>those who are ready to make allowance for
    the exaggerated indignation of the satirist, the narrowness of the
    Puritan, and the real and genuine craving after equity, justice, and
    honesty, it will become manifest that the age contained, like every
    other age, grave abuses, great injustices, and much small meanness
    and trickery. Laws were passed attempting to restrain the tricks of
    clothiers, tanners, shoemakers, and “brokers,” <i>i.e.</i> pawnbrokers and
    marine store-dealers. These laws failed, as all such laws must fail,
    because men who wish to cheat will cheat in spite of any laws that may
    be passed. In truth there is very little in Stubbes but does not belong
    to every town and every age. He laments the pride of the age. So does
    every satirist. Especially he laments Pride of Apparel. Take their hats
    for instance:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Sometimes they use them sharp on the crowne, pearking up like a
      spere, or shafte of a steeple, standing a quarter of a yard above
      the crowne of their heades; some more, some lesse, as please the
      phantasies of their inconstant mindes. Othersome be flat and broad
      on the crowne, like the battlementes of a house. An other sort have
      round crownes, sometymes with one kinde of bande, sometymes with
      an other; now blacke, now white, now russet, now red, now grene,
      now yellowe, now this, nowe that, never content with one colour or
      fashion two daies to an ende....</p>

    <p>And as the fashions bee rare and straunge, so is the stuffe wherof
      their hattes be made, divers also; for some are of silke, some
      of velvet, some of taffatie, some of sarcenet, some of wooll,
      and, whiche is more curious, some of a certaine kind of fine
      haire.... And so common a thinge it is, that everie servingman,
      countrieman, and other, even all indifferently, do weare of these
      hattes. For he is of no account or estimation amongst men, if hee
      have not a velvet or a taffatie hatte, and that muste bee pincked
      and cunningly carved of the beste fashion. And good profitable
      hattes bee these, for the longer you weare them the fewer holes
      they haue. Besides this, of late there is a new fashion of wearyng
      their hattes sprung up amongst them, which they father upon the
      Frenchmen, namely, to weare them without bandes; but how unseemely
      (I will not saie how assie) a fashion that is, let the wise judge;
      notwithstanding, howe ever it be, if it please them, it shall not
      displease me. And an other sort (as phantasticall as the rest) are
      content with no kinde of hat without a greate bunche of feathers
      of divers and sundrie colours, peakyng on top of their heades, not
      unlike (I dare not saie) Cockescombes, but as sternes of pride and
      ensigns of vanitie.” (Stubbes, 1836 edition, p. 38.)</p>

  <p>Marriages took place at an earlier age than is now common, both for
    men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> and for women. An unmarried girl of twenty was regarded as an old
    maid. Thus in the <i>Crowne Garland of Golden Roses</i> the maiden laments
    her virginity:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Twenty winters have I seen,</div>
        <div class="i1">And as many summers greene,</div>
        <div class="i1">’Tis long enough to breed despaire</div>
        <div class="i1">So long a maidenhead to beare;</div>
        <div class="i1">’Tis a burden of such waight</div>
        <div class="i1">That I would faine be eas’d of’t straight;</div>
        <div class="i1">But alasse! I am afraid</div>
        <div class="i1">I shall live and die a maid.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The betrothal took place forty days before the wedding:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“A contract of eternal bond of love,</div>
        <div class="i1">Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,</div>
        <div class="i1">Attested by the holy close of lips,</div>
        <div class="i1">Strengthened by interchangement of your rings;</div>
        <div class="i1">And all the ceremony of this compact</div>
        <div class="i1">Seal’d in my function, by my testimony.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">To make the betrothal binding there were, therefore, four points to be
    observed: (1) The joining of hands; (2) the exchange of kisses; (3) the
    exchange of rings; (4) the testimony of witnesses.</p>

  <p>After the betrothal, the wedding:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The procession accompanying a rural bride, of some consequence,
      or of the middle rank, to church was as follows:—The bride, being
      attired in a gown of sheep’s russet, and a kirtle of fine worsted,
      her hair attired with a ‘billement of gold’ (decorated with long
      chains of gold), and her hair as yellow as gold hanging down behind
      her, which was curiously combed and plaited, was led to the church
      between two sweet boys, with bride laces and rosemary tied about
      their silken sleeves. There was carried before her a fair bride-cup
      of silver, gilt, filled with hippocras and garnished with a goodly
      branch of rosemary, which stands for constancy. The cup was hung
      about with silken ribbands of all colours. Musicians followed, then
      a group of maidens, some bearing bride-cakes, others garlands of
      wheat finely gilded; and thus they passed on to the church.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The wedding customs were very pretty. The bride, like all unmarried
    women, wore a dress which exposed a portion of her bosom—you may
    see how far the exposure went by looking at any portrait of Queen
    Elizabeth; she wore her hair flowing. Some girls married very early,
    even at fifteen, which was considered quite old enough to undertake the
    duties of a wife. On the way to and from the church, wheat was thrown
    on the head of the bride, just as rice is thrown now, as a symbol of
    fruitfulness to follow. The wedding guests wore scarves, gloves, and
    favours; cake—the bride-cake—was taken to the Church and distributed
    after the ceremony; brooches were also given to the young men and
    maidens present. Then the cup of wine was sent round: the “knitting”
    cup, or the “contracting” cup; and then, carrying in her hand a piece
    of gilt rosemary, the bride led the way home, where, for three days,
    festivities, masques, mumming, music, dancing, feasting, and drinking
    were carried on. In some of the churches special pews were provided
    for newly married couples, who sat in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> them and listened, while the
    preacher discoursed on “The Bride’s Bush” or “The Wedding Garment
    Beautified.”</p>

  <p>In 1584 the Puritans got in a Bill permitting to marry at all seasons
    and on every day of the year. It had been the endeavour of the Bishops
    to keep Lent as a season in which there was to be no marrying or giving
    in marriage. Meantime, the keeping of Lent remained, if only as an
    outward sign of revolt against the Puritans.</p>

  <p>When there was a christening it was conducted in the mother’s bedroom.
    After the service, the sponsors presented “Postle Spoons”; then, of
    course, they sat down to a solid feast, or, at least, a drink—nothing
    could be done without a drink; comfits were handed round with the wine,
    and it was not unusual for some of the guests to go away royally drunk.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE CHRISTENING OF PRINCE ARTHUR<br />
      From a historical print in the British Museum.</div>
  </div>

  <p>An example of a marriage feast is that of one Coke, citizen, with the
    daughter of Mr. Nicolls, Master of London Bridge. My Lord Mayor and
    all the Aldermen, with many ladies and other worshipful men and women,
    were present at the wedding. Mr. Bacon, an eminent divine, preached
    the wedding sermon. After the discourse the company went home to the
    Bridge House to dinner, where was as good cheer as ever was known—Stow
    says so, and he knew very well—with all manner of music and dancing,
    and at night a masque till midnight. But this was only half the feast,
    for next day the wedding was again kept at the Bridge House with great
    cheer. After supper more mumming, after that more masques. One was in
    cloth of gold, the next consisted of friars, and the third of nuns.
    First the friars and the nuns danced separately, one company after the
    other, and then they danced together.</p>

  <p>At a funeral the mourners first assembled at the house where lay
    the coffin. Here the clergyman made a speech on the virtues of the
    deceased. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> coffin stood a jug or pot of wine which was passed
    round as a loving-cup. Then every one laid branches on the coffin;
    money was given to the children; to the mourners ribbons, scarves, and
    gloves were distributed; rosemary was laid in the coffin and placed
    in the mourners’ hats; as for what followed, we may take the funerals
    described by Machyn. First, the Company to which the deceased belonged,
    attended in their livery; the Company of Clerks attended the funerals
    of the better class and sang over the grave; black gowns were given
    to as many poor men and poor women as the condition of the deceased
    permitted. When a great citizen died, like Master Husee, “squire and
    a grett marchand ventorer and of Muskovia and haberdasher,” he was
    followed by a hundred mourners; he had five pennons of arms, and a
    “cotte armur,” and “two heralds of arms, Master Clarenshux and Master
    Somerset.” He was attended by the Choir of St. Paul’s and by the
    Company of Clerks; they buried him at St. Martin’s, Ludgate Hill; the
    church was hung with black and with escutcheons of arms; the Reader of
    St. Paul’s preached “both days.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

  <p>Master Flammock, grocer, who died in 1560, was apparently a Puritan.
    Many gowns were bestowed by his executors; he was taken to the church
    without singing or clerks, and was buried with a psalm, “after
    Genevay,” and a sermon.</p>

  <p>Lady Dobbes, the wife of Sir Richard Dobbes, was buried with a pennon
    of armes and four dozen and five escutcheons; many black gowns were
    given. “Master Recherdson mad the sermon, and the clarkes syngyng and a
    dolle of money of xx nobulles, and a grete dinner after and the compane
    of the Skynners in ther leverey.”</p>

  <p>Master Hulson, scrivener, was one of the Masters in Bridewell; so the
    Masters of Bridewell attended his funeral with green staves in their
    hands, and all their children, “and there was great syngyng as ever was
    heard.” And when we have added that after most of these notes occur
    this passage, “And all dune to the place, fir there was a great dener,”
    we have said all that need be said about a civic funeral.</p>

  <p>One detail is not mentioned by Machyn. This is the custom observed till
    quite recently in Yorkshire, of hanging a garland or wreath of ribbons
    in the chancel of a church when a girl died unmarried. This custom had
    many forms, one or other of which was certainly observed in London. It
    was considered unlucky to carry away a piece of ribbon; if the wreath
    dropped to pieces, all the pieces were buried in the churchyard.</p>

  <p>Persons of distinction continued to be buried within the walls of the
    church.</p>

  <p>Some Companies and some parish churches still preserve funeral palls
    which have been presented to them at various times for the use of the
    members and parishioners. Thus, in May 1848, Mr. William Wansey, Prime
    Warden of the Fishmongers’ Company, exhibited a funeral pall of most
    beautiful and elaborate workmanship, formed of cloth of gold richly
    embroidered.</p>

    <p>“This interesting relic has been preserved in the possession of the
      Fishmongers’ Company, having doubtless been originally used at the
      interments of its more distinguished members. No account of the
      acquisition of this fine specimen of decoration, or of the precise
      period when it was executed, has been preserved, and the earlier
      records of the Company were destroyed in the fire of London; its
      date may be attributed to the earlier part of the sixteenth, or
      the close of the previous century. The designs which decorate the
      head and foot of the pall are precisely similar, and the two sides
      likewise correspond exactly in design. On the former is presented
      St. Peter, the patron of fishermen, receiving from the Saviour
      the keys of heaven and hell; the embroideries on the two sides
      represent St. Peter enthroned, crowned with the tiara, with angels
      kneeling one on either side, throwing their censers towards him. On
      each side of this subject is introduced an escutcheon of the arms
      of the Company, with supporters. Nothing can exceed the delicacy
      of execution displayed in this remarkable specimen of needle-work:
      the countenances are full of expression, and the colours are
      generally remarkable for freshness and brilliancy. Another funeral
      pall of great beauty is in the possession of the Saddlers’ Company,
      and has been accurately represented in Mr. Shaw’s <i>Dresses and
        Decorations</i>.” (<i>Archæologia</i>, xxxi.)</p>

  <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">By</span> an Act of Parliament, 27 Henry II., 1181, called ‘An Assize
    of Arms,’ confirmed and enlarged by 13 Edward I., 1285, every
    man, according to his estate and degree, was obliged to provide a
    determinate quantity of such arms and armour as were then in use.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
    Constables were provided to see that their arms were correct, and
    proper persons, at stated periods, were appointed to <i>muster and train</i>
    them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
    Every Freeman that had in chattels or rent to the value of sixteen
    marks was to have a coat of mail (<i>loricam</i>), a helmet (<i>cassidem</i>),
    a shield, and a lance; and so in proportion to his wealth. Another
    Assize of Arms was passed 36 Henry III., 1252, and in 1285 the Statute
    of Winchester. These made some alterations in the qualification and
    in the weapon. By 27 Edward I., 1298, armed horses were ordered to be
    provided. The Statute of 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, c. 3, 1537, changed
    the weapons for those of more modern construction. It also provided
    that all persons having an estate valued at £1000 or more should,
    after the 1st of May 1558, keep six horses and ten light horses,
    with furniture, etc. By the 33 Henry VIII., c. 5, Commissioners were
    appointed to see that the inhabitants of cities and boroughs were
    properly provided with arms, etc. Thus cities, according to their
    wealth or position, were obliged to have ready so many trained men.
    In 1335 the City of London provided twenty-five men in arms and 500
    archers for the war against France. In 1360, 1400 to serve in France.
    Henry VIII. called upon the City to supply him with 1500 men in July
    1545. The French threatening the Isle of Wight, on the 4th of August
    1545, the citizens sent 1000 soldiers to Dover. In 1557 Queen Mary
    caused a levy to be made of 1000 horsemen, 4000 footmen, and 2000
    pioneers, to assist Philip of Spain against the King of France. In
    1558 another was made to protect Calais; and in 1560 another to assist
    the Queen’s Troops against the French, who were besieging Leith,
    in Scotland. In 1562 a large number were sent to serve at Havre de
    Grace. Orders were received from the Council in 1578 to keep 2000 men
    in readiness. The Lord Mayor, in 1580, issued a precept assessing
    the Companies for providing and furnishing 1000 men. The Stationers’
    Company had to provide twenty men, thirteen shot, and seven pikemen.
    The cost of their provision, furnishing, and training was £20:10:4; and
    for powder and other charges, £11:3s. In 1585, 4000 men, with armour,
    ensigns, drums, fifes, and other furniture for the wars, the greater
    part being shot, mustered at Mile End, 14th April, and were reviewed
    by Queen Elizabeth, 18th May. In 1596 the City twice raised, in less
    than twelve hours, 1000 men, completely armed, for the relief of the
    French, besieged by the Spaniards, in Calais. In 1589, 1000 men were
    provided, fully equipped, to assist in placing Henry of Navarre on the
    French throne. In 1600, 500 men for service in Ireland. In 1624, 2000
    for the Low Countries. In 1638–40, 200 men in all, for service against
    the Scots.”</p>

  <p>There was an ancient and time-honoured march, known as the “old English
    march,” which fell into disuse some time before the accession of
    Charles the First, when Sir Edward Cecil, Lord Wimbledon, persuaded
    the King to issue a warrant, ordering it to be revived. The point
    raised is extremely interesting. The Warrant runs thus—it is dated
    7th Feb. 1632:—“Whereas the ancient custome of Nations hath ever bene
    to use one certaine and constant forme of march in the warres, whereby
    to be distinguished one from another: and whereas the march of this
    our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> English Nation, so famous in all honourable achievements and
    glorious warres of this our Kingdome in forraigne parts (being, by the
    approbation of Strangers themselves, confessed and acknowledged the
    best of all Marches) was, through the negligence and carelessness of
    drummers, and by long discontinuance, so altered and changed from the
    ancient gravitie and majestie thereof, as it was in danger utterly to
    have bene lost and forgotten. It pleased our late deare brother prince
    Henry to revive and rectifie the same, by ordayning an establishment
    of one certaine Measure which was beaten in his presence at Greenwich,
    anno 1610. In confirmation whereof, wee are graciously pleased, at the
    instance and humble sute of our right trusty, etc., Edward, Viscount
    Wimbledon, etc., to set down and ordaine this present establishment
    hereunder expressed. Willing and commanding all drummers within our
    Kingdome of England and principalitie of Wales exactly and precisely to
    observe the same as well in this our Kingdome as abroad in the service
    of any forraigne prince or state without any addition or alteration
    whatsoever. To the end that so ancient, famous, and commendable a
    custome may be preserved as a patterne and precedent to all posteritie.”</p>

  <p>About the time of Henry the Seventh we first find mention made of coat-
    and conduct-money, a clothing allowance and subsistence for men on
    joining the army, which was sometimes advanced by the counties where
    the men were raised, to be afterwards repaid by the Government. These
    charges varied according to the times. In 1492 the conduct-money was
    calculated at the rate of 6d. for every twenty miles each soldier
    should march, to be reckoned from his residence to the place of joining
    the army; each soldier to swear to the number of the miles marched by
    him. In 1574 it was fixed at a halfpenny per mile. In 1627, coat-money
    to have been settled at 12s. 6d., and conduct-money at 8d. per diem,
    accounting twelve miles for a day’s march. In 1640 it was 8d. per diem,
    but the day’s march was not less than fifteen miles.</p>

  <p>In dress and weapons armour had not yet disappeared, but it was much
    less cumbrous. The corselet, with a morion, or open head-piece, and
    thigh guards were still in general use; but plates of armour were
    frequently fastened to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> ordinary tunic for the defence of the
    shoulders, arms, and chest. The pike-men, with their twenty-foot
    pikes, wore corselets, and were much disinclined to march more than
    five or six miles a day, owing to the weight of their dresses and
    weapons. The bill-men were in lighter armour, and their weapons were
    shorter than the pike, but very effective against cavalry. The bill
    was a hook-shaped blade fastened to a wooden staff, with a projecting
    prong at the end and back. Pike-men and bill-men were employed in
    protecting archers from cavalry and in covering such field-guns as
    were in use. Civic guards and watchmen were armed with bills. The
    archers wore a buff-padded jacket, with sometimes an under-shirt of
    light chain-armour. A jerkin, of leather or cloth, was indiscriminately
    worn by all ranks. The firearms were of two kinds, leaving out of view
    artillery. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> could be fired with a rest, and the second were
    practically very light artillery. The harquebus and the small petronel
    belonged to the first class, and the culverin, the long petronel, and
    the muschite (from the French mosquet, a hawk) to the second. Two
    men were required to handle the weapons of the second class. They
    had long barrels. They were fired with a match, the barrels resting
    on an iron fork sticking in the ground. The harquebus was originally
    a musket-stock with a bow fixed to it; but the term was now used to
    mean the long-barrelled hand-gun with a touch hole and priming pan and
    trigger on the right side, which was rapidly driving out other weapons
    and rendering armour useless.</p>

  <p>Musters of the citizens were frequent in the reign of Henry the Eighth
    and Queen Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A history of the muster of the citizens on the
    8th of May 1539, the 31st of Henry the Eighth, is given at length in
    the <i>Records of the Corporation</i>, Journal 14, folio 166. “They marched
    from Mile end to Whitehall, and from thence to Leadenhall, Sir Wm.
    Forman, Knt., Lord Mayor was in bright harness, whereof the curass, the
    maynsers, gaunteletts and other parts were gilt upon the crests and
    bordures, and with that he had a coat of black velvet with a rich cross
    embroidered, and a great massy chain of gold about his neck, and on his
    head a cap of black velvet with a rich jewel, he had a goodly jennett
    richly trapped, with embroidery of gold set upon crimson velvet. About
    him attended 4 foot men, all apparelled in white satin hose and all
    puffed over with white sarcenet.” In 1559, July 2 and 3, according to
    <i>Stow’s Chronicle</i>, edit. 1615, p. 639, “the Citizens mustered before
    Queen Elizabeth in Greenwich Park, 1400 men being present; 800 pikemen
    in fine corselets; 400 harquebuts in shirts of maile, with morins; and
    200 halberters in Alman rivets.” A large number of the citizens were
    also present. The price of armour at this date, as given in several
    records, was for “a Corslett, 30s.; Harquebus complete, 8s.; a Murrion,
    6s. 8d.; Almaine rivette, 10s.; a musket, flask, touch-box and tassels,
    17s. 6d.; Gunpowder, 12d. per pound.”</p>

  <p>Here, for instance (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxxii. p. 32), is an account of
    a muster before Henry the Eighth.</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that military array had arrived at a new and
    quite another kind of splendour. Armour had not gone out, but it was
    less cumbrous, and people believed less in its value. It availed to a
    certain extent against sword and pike, but not at all against bullet.
    The pikemen who carried pikes eighteen or twenty feet in length wore a
    breastplate; the billmen had lighter armour, their weapon was a hook or
    a staff. Both pikemen and billmen were employed in covering field-guns
    against cavalry. Watchmen also carried bills. The firearms were the
    harquebus or arquebus; the small petronel; the culverin; the long
    petronel and the musket. The larger kinds were fired with the barrel
    resting on a fork stuck in the ground. Swords and daggers were, of
    course, carried, and gentlemen wore expensive chain and plate armour.</p>

  <p>Henry VIII. had a wonderful suit of armour made in Germany. It was
    engraved with illustrations from the lives of martyrs and saints, some
    of which are reproduced on <a href="#Page_382">p. 382</a>, from the illustrations given in

      <span class="subhead">THE ’PRENTICE</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> chapter is inserted in the Tudor period because the ’Prentice in
    that century arrived at the height of his power and importance, chiefly
    as a disturber of the peace. The following pages sum up the regulations
    on the subject from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, both
    inclusive.</p>

  <p>The importance of the apprentice system caused many ordinances and
    regulations to be passed from time to time. Thus in 1406 no persons
    were allowed to put out their children as apprentices who had not
    land to the value of 20 shillings a year, a regulation intended, in a
    populous town, to keep up the <i>status</i> of trades and crafts. The Act
    was, however, found impossible to work, and was repealed in 1429 “to
    the great satisfaction of the citizens.” Later on, in 1486, another
    attempt was made to restrict the Freedom of the City, and to keep
    out “mean and improper” persons by an ordinance that no apprentice
    should be taken nor freedom given except to such as were “gentlemen
    born”—this is Maitland’s statement—“agreeable to the clause in the
    oath given to every freeman at the time he was made free, in these
    words, ‘Ye shall take none apprentice but if he be freeborn: that is to
    say, no Bondman’s son, nor the son of any alien.’” It does not appear,
    however, from the oath, that the freeman was required to be a gentleman
    unless every freeborn person is a gentleman. How could a blacksmith or
    a journeyman saddler be a gentleman?</p>

  <p>In 1527 the Common Council passed a stringent rule as to the treatment
    of Apprentices:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“‘If hereafter any Freeman or Freewoman of this City take any
      Apprentice, and within the Term of seven Years suffer the same
      Apprentice to go at his large Liberty and Pleasure; and within or
      after the said Term agree with his said Apprentice for a certain Sum
      of Money, or otherwise, for his said service, and within or after the
      End of the said Term, the said Freeman present the said Apprentice to
      the Chamberlain of the City, and by good Deliberation, and upon his
      Oath made to the same City, the same Freeman or Freewoman assureth and
      affirmeth to the said Chamberlain, that the said Apprentice hath fully
      served his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> said Term as Apprentice: Or if any Freeman or Freewoman of
      this City take any Apprentice which at the Time of the said taking hath
      any Wife: Or, if any Freeman or Freewoman of this City, give any Wages
      to his or her Apprentice, or suffer the said Apprentices to take any
      Part of their own Getting of Gains: Or if any Freeman or Freewoman of
      this City hereafter colour any foreign Goods, or from henceforth buy or
      sell for any Person or Persons, or with or to any Person or Persons,
      being foreign or Foreigners, Cloths, Silks, Wine, Oils, or any other
      Goods or Merchandize, whatsoever they be, whether he take any Thing or
      Things for his or their Wages or Labour, or not: Or if any Person or
      Persons being Free of this City, by any Colour or deceitful Means, from
      henceforth do buy, sell, or receive of any Apprentice within this City,
      any Money, Goods, Merchandize, or Wares, without the Assent or Licence
      of his Master or Mistress; and upon Examination duly proved before the
      Chamberlain of the said City for the Time being, and the same reported
      by the Mouth of the said Chamberlain, at a Court to be holden by the
      Mayor and the Aldermen of the same City in their Council-Chamber: That
      as well the said Master, as the said Apprentice, shall for evermore be
      disfranchised. <i>God save the King!</i>’” (Maitland, vol. i. pp. 229–230.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To which was added an admonition to the Apprentices:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“‘Ye shall constantly and devoutly on your Knees, every Day, serve God,
      Morning and Evening, and make Conscience in the due Hearing of the Word
      preached, and endeavour the right Practice thereof on your Life and
      Conversation. You shall do diligent and faithful Service to your Master
      for the Time of your Apprenticeship, and deal truly in what you shall
      be trusted. You shall often read over the Covenants of your Indenture,
      and see and endeavour yourself to perform the same, to the utmost of
      your Power. You shall avoid all evil Company, and all Occasions which
      may tend to draw you to the same; and make speedy Return when you shall
      be sent of your Masters and Mistresses Business. You shall be of fair,
      gentle, and lowly Speech and Behaviour towards all Men, and especially
      to all your Governors. And according to your Carriage, expect your
      Reward, for Good or Ill, from God and your Friends.’” (Maitland, vol.
      i. p. 230.)</p>

  <p>The history of “Evil May Day” (p. 24) is an illustration of the growing
    turbulence of the ‘Prentices and the relaxation of order and discipline
    in the City generally. The wards, in fact, had become too thickly
    populated for the old and simple rule of a peripatetic alderman and
    his sergeants: the turbulence was a sign of their weakness; yet three
    hundred years were to pass before an efficient night and day police
    could be established as the only remedy.</p>

  <p>In the year 1582 an ordinance concerning the apparel of the ‘Prentice
    shows still more clearly that he was getting out of hand. It was
    enacted by the Lord Mayor and Common Council:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That from henceforth no Apprentice whatsoever should presume: 1. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
      wear any Apparel but what he receives from his Master. 2. To wear no
      Hat within the City and Liberty thereof, nor any thing instead thereof,
      than a Woollen Cap, without any Silk in or about the same. 3. To wear
      no Ruffles, Cuffs, loose Collar, nor other thing than a Ruff at the
      Collar, and that only of a Yard and a half long. 4. To wear no Doublets
      but what were made of canvas, Fustian, Sackcloth, English Leather, or
      Woollen Cloth, and without being enriched with any manner of Gold,
      Silver, or Silk. 5. To wear no other coloured Cloth, or Kersey, in Hose
      or Stockings, than White, Blue, or Russet. 6. To wear little Breeches,
      of the same Stuffs as the Doublets, and without being stitched, laced
      or bordered. 7. To wear a plain upper Coat of Cloth or Leather, without
      Pinking, Stitching, Edging or Silk about it. 8. To wear no other
      Surtout than a Cloth Gown or Cloak, lined or faced with Cloth, Cotton
      or Bays, with a fixed round Collar, without Stitching, Guarding, Lace
      or Silk. 9. To wear no Pumps, Slippers, nor Shoes, but of English
      Leather, without being pinked, edged or stitched, nor Girdles nor
      Garters, other than of Crewel, Woollen, Thread or Leather, without
      being garnished. 10. To wear no Sword, Dagger, or other Weapon, but a
      Knife; nor a Ring, Jewel of Gold, nor Silver, nor Silk in any Part of
      the Apparel.</p>

    <p>It was likewise further enacted, That every Apprentice offending
      against any of the above-mentioned items, was for the first offence
      to be punished at the discretion of his Master; for the second to be
      publicly whipped at the Hall of his Company; and for the third to serve
      six months longer than specified in his indentures. And every Master
      conniving at the crimes of his Apprentice committed against the tenor
      of the premises, should, for every such offence, forfeit to the poor
      of the parish wherein he dwelt six shillings and eightpence. It was
      also farther ordained, That no Apprentice should frequent, or go to any
      dancing, fencing, or musical schools; nor keep any chest, press, or
      other place for the keeping of apparel or goods, but in his Master’s
      House, under the penalties aforesaid. And every such Master permitting
      or allowing his Apprentice to offend in any of the said cases, to
      forfeit as in the case of forbidden apparel.” (Maitland, vol. i. p. 267.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Maitland, after praising this wise ordinance, laments that in his time,
    the middle of the eighteenth century, there could not be some such good
    law passed to restrain the “more destructive practices of our modern
    Apprentices,” viz. keeping mistresses, keeping horses, frequenting
    tavern clubs and playhouses, and “their great excesses in clothes,
    Linen, periwigs, gold and silver watches, etc.” He does not tell us
    where they got the money for these expensive luxuries, but in the
    <i>Confession of Latroun Meriton</i> (1650) the way is fully explained: it
    was, namely, by robbing their masters. In the year 1595 there were more
    troubles caused by the ’Prentices. The Queen ordered sharp measures to
    be taken:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“‘And because such Assemblies and Routs were compounded of sundry Sorts
      of base People; some known Apprentices, such as were of base manual
      Occupations; some others, wandering idle Persons, of Condition, Rogues,
      and Vagabonds; and some colouring their wandering by the Name of
      Soldiers returning from the Wars, etc., therefore she had notified her
      Pleasure to her Council, to prescribe certain Orders to be published
      in and about the said City, which she would have streightly observed;
      and, for that Purpose, that she meant to have a Provost-Marshal, with
      sufficient Authority to apprehend all such as should not be readily
      reformed and corrected by the ordinary Officers of Justice, and them
      without Delay to execute upon the Gallows by Order of Martial Law. At
      our Manor of Greenwich, the 4th of July, 1595.’” (Maitland, vol. i. pp.
      278–279.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Sir Thomas Welford, accordingly, was appointed Provost-Marshal. He
    patrolled the streets with a number of horsemen armed with pistols: he
    arrested many of the rioters, who were tried at the Guildhall. Five of
    them were executed on Tower Hill, and the rioting ceased.</p>

  <p>Of the Apprentices’ riot against the Spanish Ambassador in 1641 we have
    heard in another place (<i>London in the Time of the Stuarts</i>, p. 38).
    The Lord Mayor had a good deal of trouble in appeasing the Ambassador,
    who said that he “hardly knew how to call that a City or even a Society
    of rational creatures which was seemingly divested both of Humanity and
    Government.”</p>

  <p>At the outbreak of Civil War the ’Prentices were on the side of the
    Parliament and enjoyed many opportunities of demonstrating their
    views and opinions, not only without reproach, but rather with the
    approbation of the Parliamentary party, the leaders of which encouraged
    the young fellows to enlist in their army, as, for example, by the
    following Proclamation:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“‘Whereas in Times of common Danger and Necessity the Interests of
      private Persons ought to give way to publick, it is ordained and
      declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That such Apprentices
      as have been, or shall be listed to serve as Soldiers, for the Defence
      of the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom, his Majesty’s Royal Person,
      the Parliament, and the City of London, their Sureties, and such as
      stand engaged for them, shall be secured against their Masters, their
      Executors, and Administrators, from all Loss and Inconvenience by
      Forfeiture of Bonds, Covenants, Infranchisement, or other Ways: And
      that, after this publick Service ended, the Masters of such Apprentices
      shall be commanded and required to receive them again into their
      Service, without imposing upon them any Punishment, Loss, or Prejudice,
      for their Absence in the Defence of the Commonwealth.</p>

    <p>‘And the Lords and Commons do further declare, That if it shall appear,
      that the Masters of such Apprentices have received any considerable
      Loss by the Absence of their Apprentices, they will take Care that
      reasonable Satisfaction be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> made unto them out of the publick Stock of
      the Kingdom, according to Justice and Indifferency.’” (Maitland, vol.
      i. p. 361.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1647 two Petitions of the “Young men and apprentices” were drawn
    up and presented to the House of Lords by the two factions in the
    City, that in the interest of the King being signed by 10,000 hands,
    instigated, says Maitland, by their masters.</p>

  <p>The action and attitude of the City on this occasion belong to its
    general history.</p>

  <p>The custom and practice as concerns apprentices in the eighteenth
    century are laid down by Strype in his account of the duties and rules
    of the Chamberlain’s Court.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Before him, the said Chamberlain, all Apprentices are enrolled, and
      made free; insomuch that none can set up Shop, or follow a Trade
      within the City or Liberties, if not a Freeman, and sworn before him;
      neither can any one turn over an Apprentice, but by his License. To
      him all Complaints are brought for Differences betwixt Apprentices
      and their Masters, who reconciles their Differences, and may punish,
      by Imprisonment, those that disobey his Summons, or any Apprentice
      that misdemeans himself to his Master or Mistress; but, upon the
      Apprentice’s acknowledging his Fault, and begging Pardon, with Promise
      never to offend any more, his Fault is forgiven.</p>

    <p>Such Apprentices as have justly served their Term of seven Years, and
      not broken their Indentures by Marrying, etc., are made free.</p>

    <p>Upon the Admission of every Person into the Freedom of this City, the
      Chamberlain causeth an Oath to be administered unto him, to be true to
      the King, the Government, and observe and keep the Customs of the City;
      which said Oath hath been mentioned before, Chap. XXIII.</p>

    <p>If any Master shall refuse to make his Apprentice free, when the Term
      of his Indenture is expired, upon Complaint made to the Chamberlain,
      he will cause such Master to be summoned before him, and if he cannot
      shew good Cause to the Contrary, will make the Apprentice free. And
      if an Apprentice shall be unruly or disorderly in his Master’s House,
      or commit any notorious Fault, upon Complaint made thereof, the
      Chamberlain will send one of his Officers for such Apprentice, and send
      him to Bridewell, or otherwise punish him according to the Nature of
      the Offence.</p>

    <p>If any Master shall misuse his Apprentice, by unreasonable Beating,
      not allowing him Necessaries, or by neglecting to instruct him, or the
      like, upon Complaint thereof made, the Chamberlain will send a Summons
      for the Master to appear before him; and upon due Hearing both Parties,
      will relieve the Apprentice, if his Allegations be proved to be just,
      or else leave the Apprentice to take his remedy against his Master in
      the Lord Mayor’s Court. And if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> Master refuse to appear according
      to his Summons, the Lord Mayor and Recorder, upon Complaint thereof
      made unto them, will grant a Warrant to take him, and compel him to
      appear.</p>

    <p>When an Apprentice, by the Consent of his Master, is to be turned
      over to another Master of the same trade, it must be done before the
      Chamberlain. And it is observed, that, if an Apprentice be turned over
      by the Company only of which the Master is free, it is no Obligation
      on the second Master to keep such an Apprentice; nor is the Apprentice
      compelled thereby to serve the second Master, but may depart at
      Pleasure, by suing out his Indentures against the first Master. Which
      may be done without the Privity or Knowledge of the second Master. And,
      therefore, it is absolutely necessary, that all Apprentices should
      be turned over before the Chamberlain. And thereby the first Master
      is discharged from him, and the second obliged to keep him; and the
      Apprentice will be obliged to serve the second Master, the full Term of
      his Indentures, although the same were made for nine Years, or more.
      It is the Interest of every Master and Apprentice, when any Difference
      happens between them, to refer the Matter to the Chamberlain; who will
      freely hear both Parties, and decide the Controversy, for 3s. Charge,
      viz. 1s. to the Officer for the Summons, and 2s. to the Clerk for the
      Order: Whereas, if they proceed at Law for Relief, it may probably cost
      both Parties six Pounds, or more, in Charges; and the Conclusion may be
      less satisfactory, than if decided by the Chamberlain.</p>

    <p>If an Apprentice shall omit to take his Freedom, within convenient Time
      after the Expiration of his Indentures, the Chamberlain may impose upon
      the Apprentice such a Fine, in Reason, as he shall think fit, for this
      Neglect, without just Cause to the Contrary.</p>

    <p>Every Freeman ought to take particular Care not to make an Apprentice
      free of London, by testifying for his true Service, unless such
      Apprentice shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span> have really served him. For, if he shall privately
      turn his Apprentice over to a Foreigner, and let his Apprentice
      serve such a Foreigner, and yet testify to the Chamberlain, that the
      Apprentice served a Freeman; in such Case, both the Master and the
      Apprentice may be disfranchised, and fined at the Discretion of the
      Recorder, and the Chamberlain, and may cause the Freeman’s Shop to be
      shut up.” (Strype, vol. ii. pp. 475–476.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As regards the ancient costume of an Apprentice, I again quote Stow and
    Strype:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The ancient Habit of the Apprentices of London was a flat round Cap,
      Hair close cut, narrow falling Bands, coarse side Coats, close Hose,
      Cloth Stockings, and other such severe Apparel. When this Garb had
      been urged by some to the Disparagement of Apprentices, as a Token
      of Servitude, one, many a Year ago, undertaking the Defence of these
      Apprentices, wrote thus, that this imported the commendable Thrift of
      the Citizens, and was only the Mark of an Apprentice’s Vocation and
      Calling (and which anciently, no Question, was the ordinary Habit of a
      Citizen), which Point of ancient Discipline, he said, the grave common
      Lawyers do still retain in their Profession; for the Professors of
      that Learning, we see, do at this Present retain the party-coloured
      Coats of Serving-men at their Serjeants’ Feasts; and he wished, that
      the Remembrance of this ancient Livery might be preserved by the grave
      Citizens, in setting apart a particular Time or Day for the Feast of
      their Apprenticeship, when they should wear their former Apprentice’s
      Garb; making Profession in this Way, that they gloried in the Ensigns
      of their honest Apprenticeship.</p>

    <p>In the Time of Queen Mary, the Beginning of Queen Elizabeth, as well
      as many Years before, all Apprentices wore blue Clokes in the Summer,
      and blue Gowns in the Winter. But it was not lawful for any Man, either
      Servant or other, to wear their Gowns lower than the Calves of their
      Legs, except they were above threescore Years of Age; but, the Length
      of Clokes being not limited, they made them down to their shoes. Their
      Breeches and Stockings were usually of white broad Cloth, viz. round
      Slops, and their Stockings sewed up close thereto, as if they were all
      but one Piece. They also wore flat Caps both then and many Years after,
      as well Apprentices as Journey-men and others, both at Home and Abroad;
      whom the Pages of the Court in Derision called Flat-Caps.</p>

    <p>When Apprentices and Journeymen attended upon their Masters and
      Mistresses in the Night they went before them carrying a Lanthorn and
      Candle in their hands, and a great long Club on their Necks; and many
      well-grown sturdy Apprentices used to wear long Daggers in the Day-Time
      on their Backs or Sides.</p>

    <p>Anciently it was the general Use and Custom of all Apprentices in
      London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> (Mercers only excepted, being commonly Merchants, and of better
      Rank, as it seems,) to carry Water Tankards, to serve their Masters’
      Houses with Water, fetched either from the Thames, or the common
      Conduits of London.</p>

    <p>It was a great matter, in former Times, to give 10£ to bind a youth
      Apprentice; but, in King James the First’s Time, they gave 20, 40, 60
      and sometimes 100£ with an Apprentice; but now these prices are vastly
      enhanced, to 500, 600, or 800£.” (Strype, vol. ii.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The question in 1628 arose, and was solemnly argued, whether an
    Apprentice, who is certainly bound to obedience, who must perform
    servile offices, who is corrected by his master, clothed by his
    master, and fed by his master, is or is not in a state of bondage or a
    bondsman. The question was resolved by Philipot, Somerset Herald, to
    the effect that he could not be considered a bondsman. The reason we
    may pass over. But Strype’s remarks are interesting:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“So that Apprenticeship in London is no Dishonour, nor Degradation;
      but rather an Honour, and a Degree. He is very hardy that shall embase
      honest Industry with disgraceful Censures, and too unjust, who shall
      not cherish and encourage it with Praise and Worship, as the ancient
      Policy of England did and doth, in constituting Corporations, and
      adorning the Companies with Banners of Arms, and especial Members
      thereof with Notes of Nobility. And, as it is an Honour, so it is a
      Degree, or Order of good regular Subjects; out of whose, as it were,
      Noviceship or Colleges, Citizens are supplied from Time to Time.
      We call them Colleges, according to the old Roman Law Phrase, or
      Fellowships of Men. For so indeed they are, comprehended within several
      Corporations, or Bodies of free Persons, intended to be consociated
      together for commerce, according to Conscience and Justice, and
      named Companies. So that Apprentices, according to the Esteem of our
      Commonwealth, when first they come to be Apprentices, first begin to
      be Somebody, who before were young Men without any Vocation in the
      World. And so by other Ascents or steps come to be Freemen of London,
      or Citizens; thence to be of their Companies Liveries, Governors of
      Companies, as Wardens and Masters; and Governors in the City, as
      Common-Council-Men, Aldermen’s Deputies, Sheriffs, and Aldermen; and,
      lastly, the principal Governors, or Heads of the City, that is, Lord
      Mayors. And some also have been advanced, from being Citizens, to be
      Counsellors of State to the Prince.</p>

    <p>It is further evident, that Apprenticeship doth not deprive of Gentry;
      for no Man loseth his Right to bear Arms, or to write Gentleman, unless
      he be attainted in Law for such a Cause; the Conviction whereof doth
      immediately procure Corruption in Blood; which in this Case no Man yet
      hath dreamt of. The Apprentice hath no more lost his Title and Right
      to Gentry, than he hath done to any Goods, Chattels, Lands, Royalties,
      or any Thing else, which, if he had never been any Apprentice, either
      had, might, or ought to have come unto him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span> Rights of Blood are
      more inherent than the Rights of Fortune, according to the Law Rule,
      <i>Jura Sanguinum nullo jure civili dirimi possunt</i>, i.e. The Law of
      Bloods cannot be destroyed by any civil Right. That Gentry is a Right
      of Blood, may appear by this, that no Man can truly alienate the same,
      or vest another in it, tho’ legally he may, in Case of Adoption, which
      is but a human Invention, in Imitation of Nature; and, in the Truth of
      the Thing, no Alienation at all, but a Fiction, or an Acceptation in
      Law, as if it were such. Gentry is a Quality of Blood, as Virtue and
      Learning are of one Mind.</p>

    <p>This is the Sum of what that learned Herald argued, in Confutation of
      that Opinion, that Apprenticeship extinguisheth Gentry. And he sent
      this his discourse to the Gentleman who desired his Judgment herein;
      whence, no Question, he received full Satisfaction. And the Herald took
      the more Pains in confuting this false Conceit, that it was a Thing
      unbeseeming a Gentleman to be an Apprentice to a Citizen or Burgess;
      because it had filled England with more Vices, and sacrificed more
      serviceable Bodies to odious Ends, and more Souls to sinful Lives, than
      perhaps any one other uncivil Opinion whatsoever. For they who held
      it better to rob by Land or Sea, than to beg or labour, did daily fee
      and feel, that out of Apprentices rose such as set upon them, standing
      out for lives as Malefactors; when they, a Shame and Sorrow to their
      Kindred, underwent a Fortune too unworthy.” (Strype, vol. ii. pp.
      435–436.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Apprentices in certain cases ought to be discharged:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“One was discharged from his Master, because his Master held no shop,
      and withdrew himself from the City. Another, because his Master did not
      teach him. Another, because his Master was in Ludgate, and entrusted
      him not. Another, because not enrolled within a Year. Another, because
      his Master was distracted in his Mind. Another, because his Master was
      so poor that he could not exhibit to him. Another, because his Master
      diverted himself to other Occupations than his own Mystery. Another,
      because the Master was a Leper. Another, because the Wife, after the
      Death of her Husband, taught him not. And lastly, another, because his
      Master inordinately chastised him.” (Strype, vol. ii. p. 438.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The decay of order among Apprentices may finish these notes on the
    class:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I come, in the next place, to treat of Attornies’ Clerks, Apprentices,
      inferior Tradesmen, Coachmen, Porters, Servants, and the lowest Class
      of Men in this town, which are far the most numerous: And, first, of
      the Lawyers’ Clerks and Apprentices, I find it a general Complaint,
      that they are under no Manner of Government; before their Times are
      half out, they set up for Gentlemen, they dress, they drink, they
      game, frequent the Playhouses, and intrigue with the Women; and it is
      a common Thing with Clerks to bully their Masters, and desert their
      service for whole Days and Nights, whenever they see fit. And indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
      People consider little else at this Day, in the Choice of Clerks or
      Apprentices, but the sums they are to have with them; one, two, or
      three Hundred Pounds are given with a Clerk or Apprentice, who may be
      looked upon rather as a Boarder than a Servant. He takes little Care of
      his Master’s Business, and the Master as little to instruct him in the
      Mystery of his Profession.” (Strype, vol. ii. p. 559.)</p>

    without the gates and in the Borough. A great change had come over the
    Inns: formerly the inn was a place of lodging; some of them, as the
    Inns of Court, Barnard’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, Staple Inn, were colleges
    of residence; the business of providing food and drink belonged to
    the tavern and the cook’s shop. We have now come to the time when the
    inn itself provided food. Fortunately, there remain two very useful
    descriptions of the Inns of this time. One of them is by Harrison in
    Holinshed, and the other by Fynes Moryson. First, let us take that of
    Harrison:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Those townes that we call thorowfaires have great and sumptuous innes
      builded in them for the receiving of such travellers and strangers
      as passe to and fro. The manner of harbouring wherein, is not like
      to that as some other countries, in which the host or goodman of
      the house dooth chalenge a lordlie authoritie over his ghests, but
      clene otherwise, sith everie man may use his inne as his owne house
      in England, and have for his monie how great or little varietie of
      vittels, and what other service himselfe shall thinke expedient to call
      for. Our innes are also verie well furnished with naperie, bedding,
      and tapisserie, especiallie with naperie: for beside the linen used at
      the tables, which is commonlie washed dailie, is such and so much as
      belongeth unto the estate and calling of the ghest. Ech commer is sure
      to lie in cleane sheets, wherein no man hath beene lodged since they
      came from the landresse, or out of the water wherein they were last
      washed. If the traveller have an horsse, his bed doth cost him nothing,
      but if he go on foot he is sure to pay a penie for the same: but
      whether he be horseman or footman if his chamber be once appointed he
      may carie the kaie with him, as of his own house so long as he lodgeth
      there. If he loose oughts whilst he abideth in the inne, the host is
      bound by a generall custome to restore the damage, so that there is no
      greater security anie where for travellers than in the gretest ins of
      England. Their horses in like sort are walked, dressed, and looked unto
      by certeine hostelers or hired servants, appointed at the charges of
      the good man of the house, who in hope of extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> reward will
      deal verie diligently after outward appeerance in this their function
      and calling. Herein neverthelesse are manie of them blameworthie, in
      that they doo not onlie deceive the beast oftentimes of his allowance
      of sundrie meanes, except their owners look well to them; but also make
      such packs with slipper merchants which hunt after preie (for what
      place is sure from evill and wicked persons) that manie an honest man
      is spoiled of his goods as he travelleth to and fro, in which fear also
      the counsell of the tapsters or drawers of drinke, and chamberleins
      is not seldom behind or wanting. Certes I beleeve not that chapman or
      traveller in England is robbed by the waie without the knowledge of
      some of them, for when he commeth into the inne, and alighteth from his
      horse, the hostler forthwith is verie busie to take downe his budget
      or capcase in the yard from his sadle bow, which he peiseth slilie in
      his hand to feel the weight thereof: or he miss of this pitch when the
      ghest hath taken up his chamber, the chamberleine that looketh to the
      making of the beds, will be sure to remove it from the place where the
      owner hath set it as if it were to set it more conveniently somewhere
      else, whereby he getteth an inkling whether it be monie or other short
      wares and thereof giveth warning to such ghests as haunt the house and
      are of his confederacy to the utter undoing of manie an honest yeoman
      as he journieth by the waie. The tapster in like sort for his part
      dooth marke his behaviour and what plentie of money he draweth when he
      paieth the shot, to the like end; so that it shall be an hard matter
      to escape all their subtil practises. Some thinke it a gay matter to
      commit their budgets at their coming to the goodman of the house; but
      thereby they oft bewraie themselves. For albeit their monie be safe for
      the time that it is in his hands (for you shall not hear that a man
      is robbed in his inn) yet after their departure the host can make no
      warrantise of the same, sith his protection extendeth no further than
      the gate of his owne house; and there cannot be a surer token unto such
      as prie and watch for those booties, than to see any ghest deliver his
      capcase in such maner. In all our innes we have plenty of ale, beere,
      and sundrie kinds of wine, and such is the capacitie of some of them
      that they are able to lodge two hundred or three hundred persons, and
      their horses at ease, and thereto with a very short warning make such
      provision for their diet as to him that is unacquainted withall may
      seeme to be incredible. Howbeit of all in England there are no worse
      ins than in London, and yet manie are there far better than the best
      that I have heard of in anie forren countries, if all circumstances
      be duly considered. But to leave this and go in hand with my purpose.
      I will here set downe a table of the best thorowfaires and townes of
      greatest travell in England, in some of which there are twelve or
      sixteen such innes at the least, as I before did speak of. And it
      is a world to see how ech owner of them contendeth with other for
      goodnesse of interteinement of the ghests as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> about finesse and change
      of linen, furniture of bedding, beautie of rooms, service at the table,
      costlinesse of plate, strength of drinke, varietie of wines, or well
      using of horses. Finallie there is not much omitted among them as the
      gorgeousness of their verie signs at their doores wherein some doo
      consume thirtie or fortie pounds, a mere vanitie in mine opinion, but
      so vaine will they needs be and that not onelie to give some outward
      token of the inne keeper’s welth, but also to procure good ghests
      to the frequenting of their houses in hope there to be well used.”
      (Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles</i>.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Concerning the customs in English Inns, Fynes Moryson thus writes:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“For as soon as a passenger comes to an Inne, the servants run to
      him, and one takes his horse and walks him till he be cold, then
      rubs him and gives him meate, yet I must say that they are not much
      to be trusted in this last point, without the eye of the Master or
      his servant to oversee them. Another servant gives the passenger his
      private chamber, and kindles his fier, the third puls of his bootes and
      makes them cleane. Then the Host or Hostesse visits him, and if he will
      eate with the Hoste, or at a common table with others, his meale will
      coste him six pence, or in some places but four pence (yet this course
      is lesse honourable and not used by Gentlemen); but if he will eate in
      his chamber, he commands what meats he will according to his appetite,
      and as much as he thinkes fit for him and his company, yea, the kitchen
      is open to him, to command the meat to be dressed as he likes best;
      and when he sits at Table, the Host or Hostesse will accompany him, if
      they have many Guests, will at least visit him, taking it for courtesie
      to be bid sit downe; while he eates, if he have company especially, he
      shall be offerd musicke, which he may freely take or refuse, and if he
      be solitary the musicians will give him the good day with musicke in
      the morning. It is the custom and no way disgraceful to set up part
      of sypper for his breakfast. In the evening or in the morning after
      breakfast (for the common sort use not to dine, but ride from breakfast
      to supper time, yet comming early to the Inn for better resting of
      their horses) he shall have a reckoning in writing, and if it seems
      unreasonable the Host will satisfy him either for the due price, or by
      abating part, especially if the servant deceive him in any way, which
      one of experience will soon find. I will now only add that a Gentleman
      and his Man shall spend as much as if he were accompanied with another
      Gentleman and his Man, and if Gentlemen will in such sorte joyne
      together to eate at one table the expenses will be much diminished.
      Lastly, a Man cannot more freely command at home in his owne House than
      he may doe in his Inne, and at parting if he give some few pence to the
      Chamberlin and Ostler they wish him a happy journey.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And further:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In all Innes, but especially in suspected places, let him take heed of
      his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> chamber fellowes, and always have his sword by his side or by his
      bedside; let him lay his purse under his pillow, but always folded with
      his garters or something hee first useth in the morning, lest he forget
      to put it on before he goe out of his chamber. And to the end he may
      leave nothing behind him in his Innes, let the visiting of his chamber
      and gathering his things together be the last thing he doth before hee
      put his foote into the stirrup.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">It was the custom at Taverns to send presents of wine from one room to
    another with compliments.</p>

  <p>The taverns were to the sixteenth century what the coffee-houses were
    to the eighteenth. Every man frequented his tavern: clubs were held
    in the taverns; men of the same trade met in the taverns for evening
    discourse; bargains and business affairs were conducted in taverns;
    there were good and bad taverns; those like the Boar’s Head, East
    Cheap, bore a bad character; that is to say, they were laden down by
    the character of Doll Tearsheet; others, again, where Doll and her
    friends were not admitted, were frequented by the most respectable
    merchants and divines. Music was going on in most of them all day long;
    and all day long the waiters, clad in blue and wearing white aprons,
    ran about with flasks of wine and cups, and tobacco and pipes, calling
    “Anon, Anon!” and stopping to chalk a score upon the wall.</p>

  <p>It is strange that Stow mentions neither the Boar’s Head, East Cheap,
    which must have been a well-known tavern, or Shakespeare would not have
    chosen it for the haunt of the Prince and Falstaff; nor the Mermaid,
    the haunt of Ben Jonson and the poets. Presumably the worthy antiquary
    would not have felt at home in the company of the wits.</p>

  <p>The Boar’s Head stood in that part of East Cheap now swept away. The
    statue of King William IV. marks the site. It was not an ancient
    tavern. There were no taverns formerly in East Cheap according to Stow;
    the first mention of it is in the year 1537. The courtyard was large
    enough for the performance of plays; at the back it looked out upon
    St. Michael’s churchyard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> The churchyard and church of St. Michael
    were swept away to make the approach to new London Bridge. Between
    St. Michael’s Lane, now Miles’s Lane, and a small alley, stood four
    taverns in a row: the Chicken, the Boar’s Head, the Plough, and the
    Three Kings. These taverns were thus in the midst of markets: the Grass
    Market in front; the Fish Market on the east; the Meat Market on the
    west. The tavern was rebuilt after the fire, in 1668: the new sign
    then made for it may be seen in the Guildhall Museum; on each side of
    the doorway was carved in wood a vine branch, rising three feet from
    the ground, loaded with leaves and clusters, and on the top of each a
    figure of Falstaff eight inches high. Before its demolition the house
    had ceased to be a tavern. Here was held a club of which Boswell was a
    member, in which every one assumed a Shakespearian character. It was
    the custom to hold convivial meetings in this house. There Falstaff
    and Dame Quickly and Doll Tearsheet and the whole merry company became
    real. Goldsmith wrote his essay, “A Reverie,” in this tavern, and here
    Washington Irving gave full play to his fancy, and restored the things
    that never were to the place that never knew Prince Hal.</p>

  <p>The Mermaid Tavern stood between Friday Street and Bread Street, with
    an entrance from Cheapside as well. The tavern has been immortalised by
    a poet of the seventeenth and one of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>Francis Beaumont, the former, writes to Ben Jonson:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">Or, as Fuller says of Shakespeare:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Many were the wit-combates betwixt him and Ben Johnson, which two I
      behold like a Spanish great gallion, and an English man of War; Master
      Johnson (like the former) was built far higher in Learning; Solid, but
      Slow in his performances. Shake-spear, with the English man-of-War,
      lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could turn with all tides, tack
      about and take advantage of all winds, by the quickness of his Wit and
      Invention.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lists of old taverns are, as a rule, without interest; there are,
    however, a few of the London taverns of historic importance. Two have
    been mentioned. Thus, the Nag’s Head, at the corner of Friday Street,
    was the pretended scene of the consecration of Parker, Archbishop of
    Canterbury in 1559.</p>

  <p>At the north-west of St. Paul’s Churchyard was an ancient tavern known
    as the Mitre. Here were given the concerts of the Society of Musicians;
    and their arms, representing the lyre of Apollo, with the crest of the
    Swan, being put up in the front of the house, caused the original sign
    to be jocularly transformed into that of the Goose and Gridiron. The
    Swan with Three Necks, meant originally the Swan with three “nicks” or
    marks to denote ownership. The Belle Savage was originally the Bell,
    but its landlord being a man named Savage, the house was emblazoned
    with a bell and a savage man beside it. The Elephant and Castle
    became the Pig and Tinder Box; the “Caton Fidele”—the Governor of
    Calais—became the Cat and Fiddle.</p>

  <p>Fleet Street had many well-known taverns: like those in the City they
    were mostly approached by narrow alleys leading out of the street, as
    the Rainbow, Dick’s, and the Mitre. Dick’s stands on the site of the
    printing office of Richard Tottle, law stationer in the reign of Henry
    VIII. The Cock, later moved across the road, was one of the most famous
    of the Fleet Street taverns.</p>

  <p>The “Devil” Tavern, however, was more famous even than the Mermaid.
    Ben Jonson drew the company from the latter tavern to the Devil; he
    lived at Temple Bar in order to be near the tavern. Here he founded the
    Apollo Club and wrote his famous rules in Latin, which were translated
    into English by one of his “sons,” Brome. Near the door was placed a
    gilt bust of Apollo with a “Welcome” in flowing lines:—</p>

  <p>The merchants conducted their business in the Royal Exchange, but the
    tavern was the place where the lesser traders, and the shopkeepers, and
    the people who came up from the country met, to arrange bargains and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> latter half of the sixteenth century presents a remarkable
    development of the Drama and of the Theatres in London. This
    development was like the rising tide: it advanced with a force that was
    irresistible. The Mayor and Aldermen did their best to drive out plays
    and players from their boundaries; they went, but they established
    themselves beyond the limits of the City jurisdiction. Preachers
    denounced the theatre; moralists wrote pamphlets against it; yet it
    flourished more and more. John Stockwood, preaching at Paul’s Cross,
    says:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Have we not houses of purpose, built with great charges for the
      maintenance of them, and that without the liberties, as who shall
      say, ‘There, let them say what they will, we will play.’ I know not
      how I might, with the godly-learned especially, more discommend the
      gorgeous playing place erected in the Fields, than term it, as they
      please to have it called, a Theatre.” In the same sermon he asks:
      “Wyll not a fylthye playe wyth the blast of a trumpette sooner call
      thyther a thousande<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> than an houres tolling of a bell bring to the
      sermon a hundred? Nay, even heere in the Citie, without it be at this
      place and some other certaine ordinarie audience, where shall you
      find a reasonable company? Whereas if you resorte to the Theatre, the
      Curtayne, and other places of players in the Citie, you shall on the
      Lord’s Day have these places, with many other that I cannot reckon, so
      full as possible they can throng.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Londoners might change their religion, but they were not going to
    change their sports. They were Protestant instead of Catholic; but they
    kept up their bear-baiting, their bull-baiting, their archery, their
    wrestlings, their fencing, their quarter-staff play, their running
    at the quintain, their feats of tumbling, their Morris dances and
    mummings, their plays and interludes. But the Reformation killed the
    Miracle Play. The play of modern manners, or the tragedy, or the farce,
    took the place of the religious play. And instead of acting on a stage
    in a churchyard, the players now began to act in the broad and ample
    courtyard of the inn, whose galleries afforded room for people to look
    on. The authorities looked on the play from the beginning with eyes of
    disfavour: the actor was considered a masterless man; he had no trade;
    he was a strolling vagabond; he lived upon the largesse of those who
    looked on at his performance; he was a buffoon who would assume any
    character at will to make the people laugh and cry; he must be able to
    dance and posture like the tumblers on the road. Again, all the idle
    people in the City assembled to see the play; all the vicious people
    crowded to take advantage of the throng; in the theatre every day arose
    disorders and brawls; young men of sober parentage were seduced into
    becoming players. Witness the words of Prynne:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Our own experience can sufficiently inform us, that plays and
      playhouses are the frequent causes of many murders, duels,
      quarrels, debates; occasioned sometimes by reason of some
      difference about a box, a seat, a place, upon the stage; sometimes
      by intruding too boldly into some female’s company; sometimes by
      reason of some amorous, scurrilous, or disgraceful words, that are
      uttered of or to some female spectators; sometimes by reason of
      some speeches or passages of the play, particularly applied to some
      persons present or absent; sometimes by reason of some husband, or
      co-rival’s jealousy, or affront, whose wife, or mistress, being
      there in person, is perhaps solicited, abused, or jeared at in his
      presence; sometimes by reason of the apprentices who resort to
      playhouses, especially on Shrove Tuesday; sometimes by means of
      other accidents and occasions. Many have been the murders, more
      the quarrels, the duels, that have grown from our stage-plays,
      whose large encomiums of rash valour, duels, fortitude,
      generosity, impatientcy, homicides, tyranny, and revenge, do so
      exasperate men’s raging passions, and make them so impatient of
      the very smallest injury, that nothing can satisfy, can expiate,
      but the offender’s blood. Hence it is that some players, some
      play-haunters, now living, not satisfied with the murder of one,
      have embrued their barbarous un-christian hands in the blood of
      two, of three, if not of four several men. And so far are they
      from ruing the odiousness of these their bloody deeds, that they
      glory in the number of their murders as the very trophies of their
      valour.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Queen at the beginning of her reign issued a proclamation to
    prevent players performing without license, and from handling politics
    or religion. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span> 1572 the Mayor forbade the acting of plays in London
    on the ground of the Plague and the danger of infection. Harrison
    says:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Plaies are banished for a time out of London, lest the resort unto
      them should ingender a plague, or rather disperse it, being already
      begonne. Would to God these comon plaies were exiled altogether,
      as seminaries of impiety, and their theatres pulled downe, as no
      better then houses of bawdrie. It is an evident token of a wicked
      time when plaiers waxe so riche that they can build suche houses.
      As moche I wish also to our comon beare-baitings used oin the
      sabaothe daies.” (Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles</i>.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1574 the first steps were taken towards the regulation of players
    and plays. The preamble to the ordinances is set forth by Maitland,
    with the ordinances themselves, as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The citizens in Common-Council observing, that the antient and
      innocent Recreation of Stage-Plays or Interludes, which in former Days
      ingenious Tradesmen and Gentlemen’s Servants sometimes practised, to
      expose Vice, or to represent the noble Actions of their Ancestors, at
      certain Festival Times, or in private Houses at Weddings, and at other
      Splendid Entertainments, for their own Profit, was now in process of
      Time become an Occupation; and that many there were that followed it
      for a livelihood; and, which was worse, that it was become the Occasion
      of much Sin and Evil; great Multitudes of People, especially Youth, in
      Queen <i>Elizabeth’s</i> Reign, resorting to these Plays; and being commonly
      acted on <i>Sundays</i> and <i>Festivals</i>, the Churches were forsaken, and the
      Playhouses thronged, and great Disorders and Inconvenience were found
      to ensue to the City thereby, forasmuch as it occasioned Frays and evil
      Practices of Incontinency; Great Inns were used for this Purpose, which
      had secret Chambers and Places, as well as open Stages and Galleries;
      where Maids, especially Orphans, and good Citizen’s Children, under
      Age, were inveigled and allured to privy and unmeet Contracts; and
      where unchaste, uncomely and unshamefaced Speeches and Doings were
      published; where there was an unthrifty Waste of the Money of the Poor;
      sundry robberies, by picking and cutting Purses, uttering of popular
      and seditious Matter, many corruptions of Youth, and other Enormities;
      besides sundry Slaughters and Maimings of the Queen’s Subjects, by
      falling of Scaffolds, Frames, and Stages, and by Engines, Weapons, and
      Powder, used in the Plays; and believing that, in the time of God’s
      Visitation by the Plague, such Assemblies of the People in Throngs
      and Presses were very dangerous for spreading the Infection; they
      regulated these Plays, lest the People, upon God’s gracious withdrawing
      of the Sickness, should, with sudden forgetting of the Visitation,
      without Fear of God’s Wrath, and without some Respect of those good and
      politick Means (as the Words of the Act ran) that were ordained for the
      Preservation of the Commonwealth and People in Health and good Order,
      return to the undue Use of such Enormities. Therefore, for the lawful,
      honest, comely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> Use of Plays, Pastimes, and Recreations in good Sort
      permitted by the Authority of the Common Council, it was enacted:—</p>

    <p>‘I. That no Play should be openly played within the Liberty of the
      City, wherein should be uttered any Words, Examples, or Doings of any
      Unchastity, Sedition, or such-like unfit and uncomely Matter, upon
      Pain of Imprisonment for the space of fourteen Days, and 5£ for every
      such offence. II. That no Innkeeper, Tavernkeeper, or other Person
      whatsoever, within the Liberties of the City, shall shew or play, or
      cause to be shewed or played, within his House or Yard, any Play, which
      shall not first be perused and allowed by the Lord Mayor and Court of
      Aldermen’s Order. III. No Person shall suffer any Plays to be played
      in his House or Yard, whereof he then shall have Rule, but only such
      Persons, and in such Places, as, upon good Consideration, shall be
      thereunto permitted and allowed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. IV. Nor
      shall take and use any such Benefit or Advantage of such Permission,
      until such person be bound to the Chamberlain of <i>London</i>, in certain
      Sums, for the Keeping of good Order, and avoiding of Discords and
      inconveniences. V. Neither shall use or exercise such Licence or
      Permission at any Time, in which the same shall be by the Lord Mayor
      and Aldermen restrained, or commanded to stay and cease, in any usual
      Time of Divine Service on the <i>Sunday</i> or Holiday, or receive any to
      that Purpose in Time of Service, to the same, upon Pain to forfeit for
      every Offence 5£. VI. And every Person to be licensed shall, during
      the Time of such continuance of License, pay to the Use of the Poor in
      Hospitals of the City, or of the Poor visited with Sickness, such Sums
      and Payments, as between the Mayor and Aldermen, and the Person to be
      licensed, shall be agreed upon; upon Pain that, on the Want of every
      such Payment, such License shall be utterly void. VII. All sums and
      Forfeitures to be incurred for any offence against this Act, and all
      Forfeitures of Bonds, shall be employed to the Relief of the Poor of
      the Hospitals, or of the Poor infected or diseased in the City: And the
      Chamberlain, in his own Name, shall have and recover the same, to the
      Purposes aforesaid, in the Court of the outer Chamber of <i>Guildhall</i>,
      <i>London</i>, called <i>The Mayors Court</i>.</p>

    <p>‘Provided, That this Act shall not extend to Plays shewed in private
      Houses, Lodgings of a Nobleman, Citizen, or Gentleman, which shall have
      the same then played in his Presence for the Festivity of any Marriage,
      Assembly of Friends, or other like Cause, without publick or common
      collection of Money of the Auditors or Beholders.’” (Maitland, vol. i.
      pp. 262–263.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Since the players could act no more in the City, there was nothing for
    them but to go outside. In 1574, James Burbage and some of the Earl
    of Leicester’s Company obtained the Queen’s license to act plays in
    any part of England. After receiving this license Burbage proceeded
    to build the first theatre, the house called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> simply “The Theatre.”
    This theatre was built outside the jurisdiction of the City, close to
    the remains of the Holywell Priory. After the Dissolution the church
    of this House was pulled down with most of the buildings. Houses were
    built upon its site, and the ruins themselves gradually disappeared.
    At the south-west of these ruins, on a site now marked by Dean’s Mews,
    Holywell Lane, Burbage built his theatre at a cost of £600, the money
    being advanced by his father-in-law. The theatre was in shape either
    circular or oval, probably the former. It was built for all kind of
    shows and entertainments. If a large space was wanted the whole of
    the area could be taken by the performers; raised galleries ran round
    the house; for the performance of a play, a stage was erected in the
    middle; from the nature of the case there could be no question of
    any scenery. The house was built of wood and is said to have been
    handsomely decorated; the central area was without a roof. There were
    troubles and quarrels about the lease of the house, which was taken
    down in the year 1598–99. The wood and timber of which the house was
    built were removed to Bankside, where they were used for the erection
    of the Globe Theatre.</p>

  <p>The second theatre of London was that called The Curtain. It is a fact
    which illustrates the popularity of Finsbury Fields as a place of
    resort that there should have been a second theatre erected so close to
    the first. The Curtain Theatre was built on the south side of Holywell
    Lane, Shoreditch. In the house, too, feats of arms, sword-play,
    quarter-staff, and other games took place.</p>

  <p>The third theatre (if we count The Globe as a continuation of The
    Theatre) was The Fortune, built near Golden Lane, Cripplegate.</p>

  <p>The strongest charge against the theatres was the license allowed
    to the clowns or jesters, who between the pieces, or between the
    Acts, played “jigs” or “drolls” accompanied by songs and dances, and
    impromptu jokes which were topical, and, as may be imagined, broad
    and coarse. We may easily imagine that the civic authorities, the
    preachers, and the pamphleteers, who were always assailing the player
    and driving him from place to place, were not spared when the Clown had
    the stage all to himself, with hundreds of grinning faces in front of
    him, all of whom were egging him on with laughter and applause to say
    or do something more outrageous still, and loved nothing so much as to
    see before them acted to the life some sour Puritan who could see only
    “filthie and beastlie” stuff in the noblest play by Shakespeare, or in
    any sport.</p>

      DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY VIII.</div>
  </div>

  <p class="clear">Another favourite place of resort for the citizens, especially for
    the more riotous sort, was Southwark, with its raised river-wall
    or Bankside; its numerous inns and taverns; its low-lying fields
    and its various amusements. There were amphitheatres for bear- and
    bull-baiting; in the High Street itself there was a ring for the bull;
    in Paris Gardens, on the east side of Blackfriars Bridge, were kept
    bears and dogs for the favourite, almost the national, amusement;
    there <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>was a kind of sanctuary in Southwark: here were allowed to
    reside the “Flemish Frows” still, in spite of Henry the Seventh’s
    suppression; here were held May Day games; here was held every year
    the pageant of St. George’s Day; and here, in the time of Henry VIII.,
    were collected together idlers, vagabonds, and rogues in great numbers.
    In this place, the resort of all the young bloods and the wild element
    of London, the players settled down in force. The Rose, The Hope,
    The Globe, The Swan, all built about the same time, show the steady
    popularity of the Drama, in spite of the Puritanic attacks upon it,
    which seem to have done it no manner of harm.</p>

  <p>At one end of Bankside stood the ruins of the Monastic House and
    the Clink Prison; then followed a single row of houses, at the back
    of which were the Bull-Baiting Ground and the Bear Garden; then the
    theatres already mentioned; also the Falcon Tavern, and Paris Gardens.
    All these places were built on a low-lying and marshy ground planted
    thickly with trees, intersected with ponds, ditches, and running
    streams—for instance, the Pudding Mill stream ran round two-thirds
    of Paris Gardens. For an account of the interior of a theatre and the
    presentation of a play I quote an imaginary account, in my own words:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The interior of the theatre was circular in shape. It contained three
      galleries, one above the other: the lowest called the ‘rooms,’ for
      seats in which we paid a shilling each, contained the better sorts. At
      each side of the stage there were boxes, one of which contained the
      music. The stage itself, a stout construction of timber, projected
      far into the pit, or, as Stow called it, the ‘yarde.’ At the back was
      another stage, supported on two columns, and giving the players a
      gallery about ten or twelve feet high, the purpose of which we were
      very soon to find out. On each side of the stage were seats for those
      who paid an additional sixpence. Here were a dozen or twenty gallants,
      either with pipes of tobacco, or playing cards or dice before the play
      began. One of them would get up quickly with a pretence of impatience,
      and push back his cloak so as to show the richness of his doublet
      below. The young men, whether at the theatre, or in Paul’s Walk, or in
      Chepe, seemed all intent upon showing the bravery of their attire: no
      girls of our day could be more vain of their dress or more critical of
      the dress worn by others. Some of them, however, I perceived among the
      groundlings—that is, the people on the ‘yarde’—gazing about the house
      upon the women in the galleries. Here there were many dressed very
      finely, like ladies of quality, in satin gowns, lawn aprons, taffeta
      petticoats, and gold threads in their hair. They seemed to rejoice in
      being thus observed and gazed upon. When a young man had found a girl
      to his taste, he went into the gallery, sat beside her, and treated her
      to pippins, nuts, or wine.</p>

    <p>It was already one o’clock when we arrived. As we took our seats the
      music played its first sounding or flourish. There was a great hubbub
      in the place: hucksters went about with baskets, crying pippins, nuts,
      and ale; in the ‘rooms’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> booksellers’ boys hawked about new books;
      everybody was talking together; everywhere the people were smoking
      tobacco, playing cards, throwing dice, cheapening books, cracking nuts,
      and calling for ale. The music played a second sounding. The hubbub
      continued unabated. Then it played the third and last. Suddenly the
      tumult ceased. The piece was about to begin.</p>

    <p>The stage was decorated with blue hangings of silk between the
      columns, showing that the piece was to be—in part at least—a comedy.
      Across the railed gallery at the back was stretched a painted canvas
      representing a royal palace. When the scene was changed this canvas
      became the wall of a city, and the actors would walk on the top of the
      wall; or a street with houses; or a tavern with its red lattice and its
      red sign; or a tented field. When night was intended, the blue hangings
      were drawn up and exchanged for black.</p>

    <p>The hawkers retired and were quiet; the house settled down to listen,
      and the Prologue began. Prologue appeared dressed in a long black
      velvet cloak: he assumed a diffident and most respectful manner; he
      bowed to the ground.</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i2">‘In Troy there lies the scene. From Isles of Greece</div>
          <div class="i0">The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d,</div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">In this way the mind of the audience was prepared for what was to
      follow. We needed no play-bill. The palace before us could be no other
      than Priam’s Palace. If there was a field with tents, it must be the
      battle-field and the camp of the Greeks; if there was a wall, it must
      be the wall of Troy. And though the scenery was rough, it was enough.
      One wants no more than the unmistakable suggestion; the poet and the
      actor find the rest. Therefore, though the intrusive gallants lay on
      the stage; though Troilus was dressed in the armour of Tudor time, and
      Pandarus wore just such a doublet as old Stow himself, we were actually
      at Troy. The boy who played Cressida was a lovely maiden. The narrow
      stage was large enough for the Council of Kings, the wooing of lovers,
      and the battle-field of heroes. Women unfaithful and perjured, lovers
      trustful, warriors fierce, the alarms of war, fighting and slaying,
      the sweet whispers of love were drowned by the blare of trumpets; the
      loss of lover forgotten in the loss of a great captain; and among
      the warriors and the kings and the lovers, the creeping creatures
      who live upon the weaknesses and the sins of their betters, played
      their parts upon these narrow boards before a silent and enraptured
      house. For three hours we were kept out of our senses. There was no
      need, I say, of better scenery: a quick shifting of the canvas showed
      a battle-field, and turned the stage into a vast plain covered with
      armies of Greeks and Romans. Soldiers innumerable, as thick as motes in
      the sun, crossed the stage fighting, shouting, challenging each other.
      While they fought, the trumpets blew and the drums beat, the wounded
      fell, and the fight continued over these prostrate bodies till they
      were carried off by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> friends. The chiefs rushed to the front,
      crossed swords, and rushed off again. ‘Come both you cogging Greeks!’
      said Troilus, while our cheeks flushed and our lips parted. If the
      stage had been four times as broad, if the number of men in action
      had been multiplied by ten, we could not have felt more vividly the
      rage, the joy, the madness of the battle. When the play was finished,
      the ale, the apples, and the nuts were passed round, and the noise
      began again. Then the clown came in and began to sing, and the music
      played—but oh, how poor it seemed after the great emotions of the
      play! The old man plucked me by the sleeve and we went out, and with us
      most of the better sort.” (<i>London</i>, pp. 237–239.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In addition to the foregoing, or as confirming and supplementing that
    account, I quote the following from Drake’s <i>Shakespeare and his Times</i>:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The passion for the stage continued rapidly to increase, and before
      the year 1590, not less than four or five theatres were in existence.
      The patronage of dramatic representation made an equal progress at
      Court; for though Elizabeth never, it is believed, attended a public
      theatre, yet had she four companies of children who frequently
      performed for her amusement, denominated the Children of St. Paul’s,
      the Children of Westminster, the Children of the Chapel, and the
      Children of Windsor. The public actors, too, who were sometimes,
      in imitation of these appellations, called the Children of the
      Revels, were, towards the close of Her Majesty’s reign especially,
      in consequence of a greatly acquired superiority over their younger
      brethren, often called upon to act before her at the royal theatre in
      Whitehall. Exhibitions of this kind at Court were usual at Christmas,
      on Twelfth Night, at Candlemas, and at Shrove-tide, throughout the
      reigns of Elizabeth and James, and the plays of Shakspeare were
      occasionally the entertainment of the night; thus we find <i>Love’s
      Labour Lost</i> to have been performed before our maiden Queen during
      the Christmas-holydays, and <i>King Lear</i> to have been exhibited
      before King James on St. Stephen’s night. On these occasions, the
      representation was generally at night, that it might not interfere
      with the performances at the regular theatre, which took place early
      in the afternoon; and we learn from the Council-books that the royal
      remuneration, in the age of Elizabeth, for the exhibition of a single
      play at Whitehall, amounted to ten pounds, of which twenty nobles, or
      six pounds, thirteen shillings, and fourpence, formed the customary
      fee; and three pounds, six shillings, and eightpence the free gift
      or bounty. If, however, the performers were required to leave the
      capital for any of the royal palaces in its neighbourhood, the fee, in
      consequence of the public exhibition of the day being prevented, was
      augmented to twenty pounds.</p>

    <p>The protection of the Drama by Elizabeth and her Ministers, though it
      did not exempt the public players, except in one instance, from the
      penalties of statutes against vagabonds, yet it induced during the
      whole of her long reign numerous instances of private patronage from
      the most opulent of her nobility and gentry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> who, possessing the power
      of licensing their own domestics as comedians, and, consequently, of
      protecting them from the operation of the Act of Vagrancy, sheltered
      various companies of performers, under the denomination of their
      servants, or retainers—a privilege which was taken away, by Act of
      Parliament, on the accession of James, and, as Mr. Chalmers observes,
      ‘put an end for ever to the scenic system of prior times.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There were no fewer than fourteen companies of players, under private
    patronage, who contributed to exhilarate the people of London and the
    country. Of these, Drake furnishes a chronological enumeration. “Soon
    after the accession of Elizabeth appeared Lord Leicester’s company,
    the same which, in 1574, was finally incorporated by royal licence;
    in 1572 was formed Sir Robert Lane’s company; in the same year Lord
    Clinton’s; in 1575 companies were created by Lord Warwick, and the Lord
    Chamberlain, the name of Shakspeare being enrolled among the servants
    of the latter, who, in the first year of the subsequent reign, became
    entitled to the appellation of His Majesty’s servants; in 1576, the
    Earl of Sussex brought forward a theatrical body, and in 1577, Lord
    Howard another, neither of which, however, attained much eminence; in
    1578 the Earl of Essex mustered a company of players, and in 1579, Lord
    Strange, and the Earl of Derby, followed his example; in 1591 the Lord
    Admiral produced his set of comedians; in 1592 the Earl of Hertford
    effected a similar arrangement; in 1593 Lord Pembroke protected an
    association of actors, and at the close of Her Majesty’s reign the Earl
    of Worcester had in pay also a company of theatrical performers.”</p>

  <p>As regards the management of his property in the play the author had
    the choice of two methods. He might sell the copyright to the theatre.
    In this case, to which authors frequently had recourse in the age
    of Shakespeare, the dramatist sold outright the whole rights of the
    piece, so that the proprietors of the theatre secured its performance
    exclusively to their own company. If it was a popular piece, of course,
    they were not anxious to publish it. If, however, the author kept the
    piece in his own hands, he not only had the right of publication, but
    he had, likewise, a claim upon the theatre for a benefit. This, towards
    the termination of the sixteenth century, took place on the second day,
    and was soon afterwards, as early indeed as 1612, postponed to the
    third day.</p>

  <p>The price of a drama, when disposed of to the public players, was
    twenty nobles, or six pounds, thirteen shillings, and fourpence; but
    private companies would sometimes give more than that sum.</p>

  <p>The price of a play when published was sixpence, and the poet received
    about forty shillings of an honorarium for a dedication. It has been
    stated, however, that Shakespeare received but five pounds for his
    <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

  <p>Hentzner, the German traveller, thus speaks of the theatres:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Without the City are some theatres, where English actors represent
      almost <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>every day Comedies and Tragedies to very numerous audiences;
      these are concluded with variety of dances, accompanied by excellent
      music and the excessive applause of those that are present. Not far
      from one of these Theatres, which are all built of wood, lies the
      Royal Barge, close to the river Thames; it has two splendid cabins,
      beautifully ornamented with glass windows, painting and carving; it is
      kept upon dry ground and sheltered from the weather.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The entertainment offered to the French Ambassador at the Court of
    Henry VIII. at Greenwich shows that acting and dressing formed part of
    a courtly entertainment. They began with tournaments and contests on
    foot and horse; they went on to an interlude in Latin, the altars being
    all richly dressed.</p>

  <p>“This being ended,” says the author of the <i>Life of Wolsey</i>, “there
    came a great company of ladies and gentlemen, the chiefest beauties
    in the realm of England, being as richly attired as cost could make,
    or art devise, to set forth their gestures, proportions, or beauties,
    that they seemed to the beholder rather like celestial angels than
    terrestrial creatures, and in my judgment worthy of admiration, with
    whom the gentlemen of France danced and masked; every man choosing his
    lady as his fancy served; that done, and the maskers departed, came in
    another masque of ladies and gentlewomen, so richly attired as I cannot
    express; these ladies maskers tooke each of them one of the Frenchmen
    to dance; and here note, that these noblewomen spoke all of them good
    French, which delighted them much to hear the ladies speak to them in
    their own language. Thus triumphantly did they spend the whole night
    from five of the clock at the night into two or three of the clock in
    the morning; at which time the gallants drew all to their lodgings to
    take their rest.”</p>

  <p>There was a kind of show called a Prolusion. This appears to have been
    a representation of some well-known event or legend. Thus in 1587 there
    was a Prolusion set forth by Hugh Offley, merchant-adventurer and
    leather-seller, one of the Sheriffs of the year 1588. It represented
    King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He chose 300 good
    archers, personable men; and he dressed them in black satin doublets
    and black velvet hose; every man carried a bow of yew and a dozen waxed
    arrows. They marched in goodly array from Merchant Taylors to Mile End
    Green. Queen Elizabeth in her chariot passed them, and stopped in order
    to see the show. “In her whole life,” she said, “she had never seen a
    finer company of archers.” They all fell on their knees and prayed God
    to prosper and preserve Her Majesty. She thanked them and passed on her
    way, while the archers proceeded to attack the sham forts which had
    been set up, after which those who shot best took prizes, and Master
    Hugh Offley provided a banquet for all.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to remember that the Theatre had to contend for the
    place of honour with the stately and courtly Masque. All that artist
    could do for decoration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> or stage manager could devise for machinery,
    or that poet could imagine or invent for fable, was pressed into the
    service of the Masque. The dresses the players wore were most gorgeous;
    the speeches were fine; the dances and the songs were most beautiful.
    Real mountains contained real caves; Dryads ran out of the woods;
    Naiads lay beside running streams; all the Gods and Goddesses of Ovid
    took part in the action; there were thrones of gold and silver; there
    were star-spangled skies; sea gods and river gods appeared; Tritons
    blew their shells; mermaids swam about the sea-shell of mother-of-pearl
    in which sat Venus herself. And all this time the Theatre itself had no
    scenery and no stage management and no machinery. The Masque, however,
    did not assume its full development till the next century. It will
    be found more fully treated in the chapter on the Theatre and Art in
    <i>London in the Time of the Stuarts</i>. Even more popular than the theatre
    were the sports of bear-baiting, bull-baiting, wrestling, quarter-staff
    and single-stick. The favourite place for these sports was the Paris
    Garden beyond Bankside.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>You shall read contemporary accounts of bear-baiting and bull-baiting.</p>

  <p>“Some,” says John Houghton in 1694, “keep the bull on purpose for the
    sport of baiting, cutting off the tips of his horns, and with pitch,
    tow, and such like matter, fasten upon them the great horns of oxen,
    with their tips cut off, and covered with leather, least they should
    hurt the dogs. Because these papers go into several other countries,
    I’ll say something of the manner of baiting the bull, which is, by
    having a collar about his neck, fastened to a thick rope about three,
    four, or five yards long, hung to a hook, so fastened to a stake that
    it will turn round; with this the bull circulates to watch his enemy,
    which is a mastiff dog (commonly used to the sport) with a short nose,
    that his teeth may take the better hold; this dog, if right, will creep
    upon his belly, that he may, if possible, get the bull by the nose,
    which the bull as carefully strives to defend, by laying it close to
    the ground, where his horns are also ready to do what in them lies to
    toss the dog; and this is the true sport.”</p>

  <p>But if more dogs than one come at once, if they are cowardly and come
    under his legs, he will, if he can, stamp their guts out. I believe I
    have seen a dog tossed by a bull thirty, if not forty foot high; and
    when they are tossed either higher or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> lower, the men above strive to
    catch them on their shoulders, lest the fall might mischief the dogs.</p>

  <p>They commonly lay sand about, that if they fall upon the ground it may
    be the easier. Notwithstanding this care, a great many dogs are killed,
    more have their limbs broke, and some hold so fast, that by the bull’s
    swinging them their teeth are often broke out.</p>

  <p>To perfect the history of bull-baiting, I must tell you, that the famed
    dogs have crosses or roses of various coloured ribbon stuck with pitch
    on their foreheads, and such like the ladies are very ready to bestow
    on dogs or bull that do valiantly; and when ’tis stuck on the bull’s
    forehead, that dog is hollowed that fetches it off, though the true
    courage and art is to hold the bull by the nose ’till he roars, which a
    courageous bull scorns to do.</p>

  <p>Often the men are tossed as well as the dogs; and men, bull, and dogs,
    seem exceedingly pleased, and as earnest at the sport as if it were for
    the lives or livelihoods. Many great wagers are laid on both sides,
    and great journeys will men and dogs go for such a diversion. I knew
    a gentleman that bought a bull in Hertfordshire on purpose to go a
    progress with him, at a great charge, into most of the great towns in
    the West of England.</p>

  <p>This is a sport the English much delight in; and not only the baser
    sort, but the greatest lords and ladies.”</p>

  <p>And here is Laneham on the sport of bear-baiting:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It waz a sport very pleazaunt of theez beasts; to see the bear with
      hiz pink eyez leering after hiz enemiez approch, the nimbleness and
      wayt of the dog to take hiz avauntage, and the fors and experiens of
      the bear agayn to avoyd the assaults; if he were bitten in one place,
      hoow he woold pynch in an oother too get free; that if he wear taken
      onez, then what shyft with byting, with clawyng, with roring, tossing
      and tumbling he woold woork too wynde hymself from them; and when he
      waz lose, to shake his earz twyse or thryse wyth the blud and slauer
      aboout his fiznamy, waz a matter of a goodly releef.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We have already heard Hentzner on theatres, he has a word to say also
    on baiting:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“There is still another place, built in the form of a Theatre, which
      serves for the baiting of bulls and bears; they are fastened behind,
      and then worried by those great English dogs and mastiffs, but not
      without great risk to the dogs from the teeth of the one and the
      horns of the other, and it sometimes happens they are killed on the
      spot; fresh ones are immediately supplied in the places of those
      that are wounded or tired. To this entertainment often follows that
      of whipping a blinded bear, which is performed by five or six men,
      standing in a circle with whips which they exercise upon him without
      any mercy; although he cannot escape from them because of his chain, he
      nevertheless defends himself vigorously, throwing down all who come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
      within his reach and are not active enough to get out of it, tearing
      the whips out of their hands and breaking them. At these spectacles,
      and everywhere else, the English are constantly seen smoking the
      Nicotean weed, which in America is called Tobaca, and generally in this
      manner: they have pipes on purpose made of clay, into the farther end
      of which they put the herb, so dry that it may be rubbed into powder,
      and lighting it, they draw the smoke into their mouths, which they
      puff out again through their nostrils, along with plenty of phlegm and
      defluxion from the head. In these Theatres, fruits, such as apples,
      pears, and nuts, according to the season, are carried about to be sold,
      as well as wine and ale.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But besides these cruel forms of so-called “sport,” there were more
    legitimate pleasures such as archery.</p>

  <p>“During the holy days in summer,” Fitz Stephen says, “the young men
    exercise themselves in the sports of leaping, archery, etc.” The
    practice of archery was maintained in the City after the longbow had
    to give way before gun and cannon. As a pastime of the citizens only,
    no account of London would be complete without reference to archery.
    There were, as every one knows, two kinds of bow: the longbow and the
    crossbow. The former, for various reasons—its superiority in readiness
    of handling, lightness in carrying, range of flight and sureness of
    aim, caused it to be much more generally adopted in our armies than
    its rival. At Cressy, for instance, our men were armed with longbows,
    and the French with crossbows; when the rain fell the longbows could
    be easily covered up, the crossbow could not, so that the strings
    were wetted and the power of the weapon greatly injured. Edward the
    First, who had a great opinion of the longbow as the superior weapon,
    ordered, on the threat of war with France, every sheriff of a county
    to provide 500 white bows and as many bundles of arrows. Edward the
    Third issued repeated proclamations ordering the practice of archery.
    It would seem as if the word archery in the fourteenth century included
    the crossbow as well as the longbow, for Edward the Second, in 1314
    (Riley, <i>Memorials</i>, p. 124), commanded the City of London to furnish
    300 arbalesters “more powerful for defence,” and to provide them
    with “haketons, bacinets, collerettes, arbalests and quarels.” (The
    haketon was a jacket of quilted leather; the bacinet was a headpiece;
    the collerette, an iron collar for the protection of the throat; the
    arbalest is the crossbow; the quarel was the bolt.)</p>

  <p>Richard the Second ordered that every man in his household should
    exercise himself as occasion should permit in archery. And in 1392 an
    Act was passed obliging all servants to practise archery on holydays.
    In 1417 Henry V. ascribed his victory at Agincourt chiefly to his
    archers, and orders the Sheriffs of the counties to pluck from every
    goose six wing-feathers for the improvement of the arrow. These
    feathers were the second, third, and fourth of each wing. Edward IV.
    ordered that Englishmen in Ireland and every Irishman living with
    Englishmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> should be provided with a bow of his own height, which was
    to be made of yew, wych, hazel, ash, or alder. Butts were to be erected
    in every township, and the inhabitants were to practise on every feast
    day. The same king sent a thousand archers to the Duke of Burgundy,
    who was to pay them sixpence a day, about five shillings of our money.
    Nothing can prove more conclusively the estimation in which archers
    were held. The same king provided for his war both guns and bows. A
    great deal of yew was imported at this time; it came in the Venetian
    ships from Dalmatia and the countries on the eastern shores of the
    Adriatic.</p>

  <p>In the nineteenth year of Henry VII. the King finally decided for the
    longbow against the crossbow, because “the longbow had been much used
    in this realm, whereby honour and victory had been gotten against
    outward enemies; the realm greatly defended; and much more the dread of
    all Christian Princes by reason of the same.” Henry VII. himself shot
    at the butts.</p>

  <p>There were at least five statutes issued by Henry VIII. ordering the
    practice of archery, but forbidding the crossbow.</p>

  <p>The London Archers continued to hold their yearly contests in the
    month of September, in spite of the fact that henceforth there would
    be no use for the longbow in warfare. They formed a very fine corps,
    had they been of any use; meantime, the City has always loved a show,
    and a very fine show the Archers provided. Their captain was called
    the Duke of Shoreditch; the captains of the different Companies were
    called the Marquesses of Clerkenwell, Islington, Hoxton, and the Earl
    of Pancras,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> etc.; in the year 1583 they assembled at Merchant
    Taylors Hall to the number of 3000 all sumptuously apparelled, “nine
    hundred and forty-two having chains of gold about their necks.” They
    were escorted by whifflers and bowmen to the number of 4000, besides
    pages and footmen; and so marching through Broad Street, where the
    Duke of Shoreditch lived, they proceeded by Moorfields and Finsbury to
    Smithfield, where, after performing their evolutions, they shot at the
    target for glory.</p>

  <p>The Finsbury Archers continued to exist and to hold their meetings
    till well into the eighteenth century. Mr. Daines Barrington, writing
    for the Society of Antiquaries in 1787, mentions that there were still
    living two old men who had obtained prizes in these contests as late
    as 1753, when they ceased. The same writer gives a map of the butts or
    archers’ marks in Finsbury Fields as they were standing in the year
    1787. The distance between the marks varies from 120 feet to 300 feet.
    It may be assumed that 200 feet was a fairly average distance for an
    arrow. The proper weight for an arrow was considered to be one ounce
    only; it was to be winged by three feathers: two white being plucked
    from the gander, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>one gray taken from the goose; this difference in
    colour showed the archer when the arrow was properly placed.</p>

  <p>The Artillery Company or Finsbury Archers, predecessors of the present
    Artillery Company, enjoyed certain privileges as to dress, as to
    shooting at birds, and immunity from the charge of murder should any
    one be killed by these arrows, especially after they had cried “Fast!”
    as a warning.</p>

  <p>It appears that bows and arrows were employed long after they left
    the field of battle for shooting rabbits and crows, partly because
    gunpowder was dear, but chiefly because the arrow makes no noise to
    frighten the game away. The London Archers continued, in spite of the
    fact that henceforth there would be no use of the longbow in warfare,
    to hold their yearly contests in the month of September.</p>

  <p>The Honourable Artillery Company, before it received its letters
    patent, had been in the habit of practising archery in the fields of
    Islington, Hoxton, and Shoreditch. In these fields targets or butts
    were fixed to shoot at. Two of these butts or targets were still in
    existence in 1860: one at the end of Dorchester Street, Hoxton, on the
    east side of the New North Road near the Canal Bridge, and the other in
    the brickwork of the Canal Bridge above the towing-path. Two others had
    been destroyed about the year 1845: one in the Britannia Fields, and
    the other in the ground now called Wellington Square. That standing at
    the end of Dorchester Road was called “Whitehall.” A drawing of it is
    given in the <i>L. and M. Arch. Society</i> (vol. ii. p. 15).</p>

  <p>The other sports, feasts, and festivals of the City remained in the
    sixteenth century much as they had been before the change of Faith with
    certain exceptions, such as the Boy Bishop, the Feast of All Fools in
    the Church, and the Miracle Play with its profanity and coarseness.
    These vanished. There remained the Feasts of Christmas and Easter; the
    celebration of May Day; the Vigils of St. John, St. Peter, and St.
    Paul; and the Midsummer Watch. There were also Shrove Tuesday, Hocking
    Day, Whitsuntide, and Martinmas, with some others. The ceremonies of
    a Christmas banquet are preserved in Gerard Leigh’s <i>Accidence of
      Armory</i>, and have been reproduced by Nichols. The feast was that of the
    year 1561. The place was the Temple. The person called Palaphilos was
    the Constable and Marshall, Dudley, Earl of Leicester.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The next day I thought for my pastime to walk to this Temple,
      and entring in at the gates, I found the building nothing costly;
      but many comely Gentlemen of face and person, and thereto very
      courteous, saw I pass to and fro, so as it seemed a Prince’s port
      to be at hand; and passing forward, entred into a Church of antient
      building, wherein were many monuments of noble personages armd in
      knightly habit, with their cotes depainted in ancient shields,
      whereat I took pleasure to behold. Thus gazing as one bereft
      with the rare sight, there came unto me an Hereaught, by name
      Palaphilos, a King of Armes, who curteously saluted me, saying,
      ‘For that I was a stranger, and seeming by my demeanour a lover of
      honour, I was his guest of right’: whose curtesy (as reason was)
      I obeyed; answering ‘I was at his commandment.’ ‘Then,’ said he,
      ‘ye shall go to mine own lodging here within the Palace, where we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
      will have such cheer as the time and country will yield us’: where,
      I assure you, I was so entertained, as no where I met with better
      cheer or company, etc.</p>

    <p>Thus talking we entred the Prince his Hall, where anon we heard the
      noise of drum and fyfe. ‘What meaneth this drum?’ said I. Quoth
      he, ‘This is to warn Gentlemen of the Houshold to repair to the
      dresser; wherefore come on with me, and ye shall stand where ye may
      best see the Hall served; and so from thence brought me into a long
      gallery, that stretched itself along the Hall neer the Prince’s
      table, where I saw the Prince set: a man of tall personage, a
      manly countenance, somewhat brown of visage, strongly featured,
      and thereto comely proportioned in all lineaments of body. At the
      nether end of the same table were placed the Embassadors of sundry
      Princes. Before him stood the carver, sewer, and cup-bearer, with
      great number of gentlemen wayters attending his person; the ushers
      making place to strangers of sundry regions that came to behold
      the honour of this mighty Captain. After the placing of these
      honourable guests, the Lord Steward, Treasurer, and Keeper of
      Pallas Seal, with divers honourable personages of that Nobility,
      were placed at a side-table neer adjoining the Prince on the
      right hand, and at another table on the left side were placed the
      Treasurer of the Household, Secretary, the Prince his Serjeant at
      the Law, four Masters of the Revels, the King of Arms, the Dean of
      the Chappel, and divers Gentlemen Pensioners to furnish the same.
      At another table on the other side were set the Master of the Game,
      and his Chief Ranger, Masters of Houshold, Clerks of the Green
      Cloth and Check, with divers other strangers to furnish the same.
      On the other side against them, began the table, the Lieutenant of
      the Tower, accompanied with divers Captains of foot-bands and shot.
      At the nether end of the Hall began the table, the High Butler, the
      Panter, Clerks of the Kitchin, Master Cook of the Privy Kitchin,
      furnished throughout with the souldiers and guard of the Prince;
      all which, with number of inferior officers placed and served in
      the Hall, besides the great resort of strangers I spare to write.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Prince so served with tender meats, sweet fruits, and dainty
      delicates confectioned with curious cookery, as it seemed wonder a
      world to observe the provision; and at every course the trumpetters
      blew the couragious blast of deadly war, with noise of drum and
      fyfe, with the sweet harmony of violins, sackbutts, recorders, and
      cornetts, with other instruments of music, as it seemed Apollo’s
      harp had turned their stroke. Thus the Hall was served after the
      most ancient order of the Island; in commendation whereof I say,
      I have also seen the service of great Princes, in solemn seasons
      and times of triumph, yet the order hereof was not inferior to
      any. But to proceed, this Hereaught Palaphilos, even before the
      second course came in, standing at the high table said in this
      manner: ‘The mighty Palaphilos, Prince of Sophie, High Constable
      Marshall of the Knights Templars, Patron of the Honourable Order of
      Pegasus’; and therewith cryeth ‘A Largess.’ The Prince, praysing
      the Hereaught, bountifully rewarded him with a chain to the value
      of an hundred talents.</p>

    <p>I assure you, I languish for want of cunning, ripely to utter that
      I saw so orderly handled appertaining to service; wherefore I
      cease, and return to my purpose.</p>

    <p>The supper ended, and tables taken up, the High Constable rose,
      and a while stood under the place of honour, where his achievement
      was beautifully embroidered and devised of sundry matters, with
      the Ambassadors of foreign nations, as he thought good, till
      Palaphilos, King of Armes, came in, his Hereaught Marshal, and
      Pursivant before him; and after followed his messenger and Caligate
      Knight; who putting off his coronal, made his humble obeysance to
      the Prince, by whom he was commanded to draw neer, and understand
      his pleasure; saying to him, in few words, to this effect:
      ‘Palaphilos, seeing it hath pleased the high Pallas to think me
      to demerit the office of this place; and thereto this night past
      vouchsafed to descend from heavens to increase my further honour,
      by creating me Knight of her Order of Pegasus; as also commanded
      me to join in the same Society such valiant Gentlemen throughout
      her province whose living honour hath best deserved the same,
      the choice whereof most aptly belongeth to your skill, being the
      watchman of their doings and register of their deserts; I will
      ye choose as well throughout our whole armyes, as elsewhere, of
      such special gentlemen, as the gods hath appointed, the number of
      twenty-four, and the names of them present us: commanding also
      those chosen persons to appear in our presence in knightly habit,
      that with conveniency we may proceed in our purpose. This done
      Palaphilos obeying his Prince’s commandement, with twenty-four
      knights, all apparelled in long white vestures, with each man a
      scarf of Pallas colours, and them presented, with their names, to
      the Prince; who allowed well his choice, and commanded him to do
      his office. Who, after his duty to the Prince, bowed towards these
      worthy personages, standing every man to his antienty, as he had
      born armes in the field, and began to shew his Prince’s pleasure;
      with the honour of the Order.”</p>

  <p>And here is a note from Stow on Christmas Customs:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Against the feast of Christmas, every man’s house, as also their
      parish churches, were decked with holm, ivie, bayes, and whatsoever the
      season of the yeere aforded to be greene; the conduits and standards
      in the streets were likewise garnished. Amongst the which, I read,
      that in the yeere 1444, by tempest of thunder and lightning, on the
      first of February at night, Paul’s steeple was fired, but with great
      labour quenched, and toward the morning of Candlemas day, at the Leaden
      Hall in Cornhill, a standard of tree, beeing set up in the midst of
      the pavement fast in the ground, nayled full of holme and ivy, for
      disport of Christmas to the people, was torne up and cast downe by the
      malignant spirit (as was thought), and the stones of the pavement all
      about were cast in the streetes, and into divers houses, so that the
      people were wore agast at the great tempests.”</p>

  <p>Philip Stubbes says:—“Against Maie, Whitsondaie, or some other tyme
    of the yeare, every parishe, towne, and village assemble themselves
    together, bothe men, women, and children; and either goyng all
    together, or deviding themselves into companies, they goe some to the
    woodes and groves, some to the hilles and mountaines, some to one
    place, some to another, where they spend all the night in pleasant
    pastymes, and in the mornyng they returne bringing with them, birch,
    bouwes, and braunches of trees to deck their assemblies withal. But
    their chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their Maie poole, which
    they bring home with greate veneration, as thus:—They have twentie or
    fortie yoke of oxen, every oxe havyng a swete nosegaie of flowers tyed
    on the tippe of his hornes, and these oxen drawe home the Maie poole
    (this stinckyng idoll rather), which is covered all over with flowers
    and hearbes, bounde rounde aboute with stringes from the top to the
    bottome, and sometyme painted with variable colours, with two or three
    hundred men, women, and children followyng it with greate devotion.
    And thus being reared up, with handkerchiefes and flagges streamyng on
    the toppe, they strawe the grounde aboute, binde greene boughs about
    it, sett up sommer halles, bowers, and arbours hard by it; and then
    fall they to banquet and feast, to leape and daunce aboute it, as the
    heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles.... I have heard
    it credibly reported,” he sarcastically adds, “by men of great gravity,
    credite, and reputation, that of fourtie, three score, or a hundred
    maides goyng to the wood over night, there have scarcely the third
    parte of them returned home againe as they went.” (<i>The Anatomie of

  <p class="noindent">Of the festive appearance of the streets in summer, and
    the hospitality of the citizens, and the setting of the Midsummer
    Watch, Stow speaks at length (Thoms’s edition, p. 39):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the months of June and July, on the vigils of festival days, and
      on the same festival days in the evenings after the sun setting, there
      were usually made bonfires in the streets, every man bestowing wood or
      labour towards them; the wealthier sort also, before their doors, near
      to the said bonfires, would set out tables on the vigils, furnished
      with sweet bread and good drink, and on the festival days with meats
      and drinks plentifully, whereunto they would invite their neighbours
      and passengers also to sit and be merry with them in great familiarity,
      praising God for His benefits bestowed on them. These were called
      bonfires as well of good amity amongst neighbours that being before at
      controversy were there, by the labour of others, reconciled, and made
      of bitter enemies loving friends; and also for the virtue that a great
      fire hath to purge the infection of the air. On the vigil of St. John
      the Baptist, and on St. Peter and Paul the apostles, every man’s door
      being shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St. John’s wort, orpin,
      white lilies, and such like, garnished upon with garlands of beautiful
      flowers, had also lamps of glass, with oil burning in them all the
      night; some hung out branches of iron curiously wrought, containing
      hundreds of lamps alight at once, which made a goodly show, namely in
      New Fish Street, Thames Street, etc.”</p>

  <p>At Whitsuntide 1900 I was at Treves. It is the custom on Whit Sunday
    to hold a great procession in which, apparently, the whole population
    takes part through the principal streets to the Cathedral. The girls
    are dressed in white with white flowers in their hair; the younger
    girls carry baskets filled with white flowers; men, women, and children
    are all chanting as they go; groups of priests, boys in scarlet,
    beadles and other ecclesiastical selections, adorn the procession. If
    that were all I should not notice it in this place. But in addition
    every street through which the procession passed was decorated with
    branches. And here for the first time I understood the lines already

    covered with great boughs closely placed side by side so as to look
    like a lane of trees. Herrick did not exaggerate.</p>

  <p>Stow goes on to speak of the Marching Watch:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Besides the standing Watches all in bright Harness, in every Ward
      and Street in this city and Suburbs, there was also a Marching Watch,
      that passed through the principal Streets thereof, to wit, from the
      little conduit by Paul’s Gate to West Cheap, by the Stocks through
      Cornhill, by Leaden Hall to Aldgate, then back down Fenchurch Street,
      by Grasse church, about Grasse church conduit, and up Grasse church
      street into Cornhill, and through it into West Cheap again, and so
      broke up. The whole way ordered for this marching watch extendeth to
      three thousand two hundred Taylor’s Yards of Assize; for the furniture
      whereof with Lights, there were appointed seven hundred cressets, five
      hundred of them being found by the Companies, the other two hundred
      by the Chamber of London. Besides the which Lights every Constable in
      London, in number more than two hundred and forty, had his Cresset;
      the charge of every Cresset was in Light two shillings and fourpence,
      and every cresset had two men, one to bear or hold it, another to bear
      a Bag with Light, and to serve it, so that the Poor Men pertaining
      to the Cressets, taking Wages, besides that every one had a strawen
      Hat, with a Badge painted, and his breakfast, amounted in number to
      almost two thousand. The marching Watch contained in number about two
      thousand men, part of them being old Soldiers, of skill to be Captains,
      Lieutenants, Serjeants, Corporals, etc., Wiflers, Drummers, and Fifes,
      Standard and Ensign Bearers, Demilances on great Horses, Gunners with
      hand guns, or half Hakes, Archers in coats of white Fustian, signed
      on the breast and back with the Arms of the City, their Bows bent in
      their Hands, with Sheafs of Arrows by their Sides; Pikemen in bright
      Corslets, Burganets, etc., Halbards, the like the Billmen in Almain
      Rivets, and Aprons of Mail in great Number. There were also divers
      Pageants, Morris Dancers, Constables, the one-half, which was one
      hundred and twenty on St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> John’s Eve, the other half on St. Peter’s
      Eve, in bright harness, some over Gilt, and every one a jornet of
      Scarlet thereupon, and a Chain of Gold, his henchman following him, his
      Minstrels before him, and his Cresset Light passing by him, the Waits
      of the City, the Mayor’s officers for his Guard before him, all in a
      livery of woosted, or Sea Jackets party-coloured, the Mayor himself
      well mounted on Horseback, the Swordbearer before him in fair Armour
      well mounted also, the Mayor’s Footmen, and the like Torch Bearers
      about him, Henchmen twain upon great stirring Horses, following him.
      The Sheriffs’ Watches came one after the other in like Order, but not
      so large in Number as the Mayor’s; for where the Mayor had, besides his
      Giant, three Pageants, each of the Sheriffs had, besides their Giants,
      but two Pageants; each their Morris Dance, and one Henchman, their
      Officers in jackets of woosted or Sea, party-coloured, differing from
      the Mayor’s and each from other, but having harnessed Men a great many.</p>

    <p>This Midsummer Watch was thus accustomed yearly, time out of Mind,
      until the year 1539, the 31st of Henry VIII., in which year, on the 8th
      of May, a great Muster was made by the Citizens at the Mile’s End, all
      in bright Harness, with Coats of White Silk, or Cloth and Chains of
      Gold, in three great Battels, to the number of fifteen thousand, which
      passed through London to Westminster, and so through the Sanctuary, and
      round about the Park of St. James, and returned home through Oldborne.
      King Henry, then considering the great Charges of the Citizens for the
      Furniture of this unusual Muster, forbad the Marching Watch provided
      for at Midsummer for that Year; which being once laid down, was not
      raised again till the year 1548, the 2nd of Edward VI., Sir John
      Gresham then being Mayor, who caused the Marching Watch, both on the
      eve of St. John Baptist and of St. Peter the Apostle, to be revived and
      set forth in as comely order as it hath been accustomed, which Watch
      was also beautified by the number of more than three hundred Demilances
      and light Horsemen, prepared by the citizens to be sent into Scotland
      for the rescue of the town of Haddington, and others kept by the
      Englishmen.” (Stow, vol. i.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As for dancing, never was there a time when it was more popular.
    Everybody danced: the Queen at Whitehall danced the brawl; the
    kitchen-maid in the street danced the ney. They danced the solemn
    <i>pavane</i>, the <i>Cassamezzo galliard</i>, the <i>canary</i> dance, the <i>Coranto</i>,
    the <i>Cavolta</i>, the <i>jig</i>, the <i>galliard</i>, the <i>fancy</i>, and the <i>Ney</i>,
    and perhaps many more. They played cards: they played at primiero,
    trumpe, gleek, gresso, new cut, knave out of doors, ruff, noddy, most
    and pace; they got through the long winter evenings mainly with the
    help of cards. Bowling was a summer amusement; tournaments belonged
    to the Court; hunting was an amusement for the richer sort; the
    people also fought cocks, wrestled, practised archery, and played
    quarter-staff. The old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span> Catholic feasts and sports—such as the
    Feast of Fools, the Boy Bishop, the Mysteries in the Churches, were
    abolished; but in their own houses they had mumming and mummers; for
    the ladies there was embroidery; there was also fine work of all
    kinds. And there was a great demand for monsters: a pig with eight
    legs; strange fishes caught in the river; a mermaid quite fresh,
    unfortunately dead, caught off the Yarmouth Roads; a calf with
    two backs; a lobster with six claws; these things were always on
    exhibition, for the most part, in Fleet Street. Their Morris dances,
    their Maypoles, Whitsun Ales, their fairs and wakes, and, in fact,
    every occasion for meeting together, singing, feasting, and dancing,
    this Protestant city kept up.</p>

  <p>Among the amusements of the people must not be forgotten the common
    custom of telling stories. The long evenings when the family gathered
    round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span> the fire, the only light in the room, were tedious: they could
    hardly go to bed much before eight, though they rose long before
    daybreak. Story-telling was an amusement which had long ago pleased the
    Saxons and the Danes, who recounted the great deeds of their ancestors
    to wile away the winter evening. Perhaps many of the stories which
    found their way into books during the sixteenth century served this
    purpose, while the merry jests of Skogan, and Peele, and the rest,
    certainly formed part of the story-teller’s <i>répertoire</i>.</p>

  <p>Another amusement was that of reading. We have already seen what an
    immense field was opened up for those who loved books, by the shoals
    which during Elizabeth’s reign were issued from the press.</p>

  <p>The first Lottery was set on foot in the year 1559. The drawing took
    place at the west door of St. Paul’s, and continued daily from the
    11th of January to the 6th of May following. The Lottery did not gain
    its full power until the eighteenth century. It is sufficient here
    to record the first appearance of this baleful institution, fruitful
    mother of crime.</p>

      <span class="subhead">THE POOR</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Harrison</span> says that there are “four kinds of poor: the poor by
    impotence, as the fatherless child, the blind man, and the incurably
    sick man; the poor by casualty, as the wounded soldier; the thriftless
    poor, as the rioter that hath consumed all; the vagabond that will
    abide nowhere; and, finally, the rogues and strumpet which are not
    possible to be divided in sunder.”</p>

  <p>As regards the last sort. Harrison’s description tells everything that
    is wanted.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Such as are idle beggars through their owne default are of two sorts,
      and continue their estates either by casuall or meere voluntarie
      meanes: those that are such by casuall means, are in the beginning
      justlie to be referred either to the first or second sort of poore
      afore mentioned; but degenerating into the thriftlesse sort, they doo
      what they can to continue their miserie, and with such impediments as
      they have to straie and wander about, as creatures abhorring all labour
      and every honest exercise. Certes I call these casuall meanes, not in
      respect of the originall of their povertie, but of the continuance of
      the same, from whence they will not be delivered, such is their owne
      ungratious lewdnesse and froward disposition. The voluntarie meanes
      proceed from outward causes, as by making of corosives, and applieng
      the same to the more fleshie parts of their bodies; and also laieng
      of ratsbane, sperewort, crowfoot, and such like unto their whole
      members, thereby to raise pitifull and odious sores and moove the
      harts of the goers by such places where they lie, to yerne at their
      miserie and bestow large almesse upon them. How artificiallie they
      beg, what forcible speech, and how they select and choose out words of
      vehemencie, whereby they doo in maner conjure or adjure the goer by to
      pitie their cases, I passe over to remember, as judging the name of
      God and Christ to be more conversant in the mouths of none; and yet
      the presence of the heavenlie majestie further off from no men than
      from this ungracious companie. Which maketh me to think that punishment
      is farre meeter for them than liberalitie or almesse, and sith Christ
      willeth us cheeflie to have a regard to Himselfe and His poore members.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

    <p>Unto this nest is another sort to be referred, more sturdie than the
      rest, which having sound and perfect limbs, doo yet, notwithstanding,
      sometime counterfeit the possession of all sorts of diseases. Divers
      times in their apparell also they will be like serving-men or laborers;
      oftentimes they can plaie the mariners, and seeke for ships which they
      never lost. But in fine, they are thieves and caterpillars in the
      common-wealth, and by the word of God not permitted to eat, sith they
      doo but lick the sweat from the true labourers’ browes, and beereve
      the godly poore of that whiche is due unto them, to mainteine their
      excesse, consuming the charitie of well-disposed people bestowed upon
      them, after a most wicked and detestable manner.</p>

    <p>It is not yet full threescore yeares since this trade began; but how it
      hath prospered since that time, it is easie to judge, for they are now
      supposed, of one sex and another, to amount unto about 10,000 persons;
      as I have heard reported. Moreover, in counterfeiting the Egyptian
      rogues, they have devised a language among themselves, which they name
      Canting, but other pedlers French, a speech compact thirtie years since
      of English, and a great number of od words of their own devising,
      without all order or reason; and yet such is it as none but themselves
      are able to understand. The first deviser thereof was hanged by the
      necke, a just reward no doubt for his deserts, and a common end to all
      of that profession....</p>

    <p>The punishment that is ordeined for this kind of people is verie sharpe
      and yet it can not restreine them from their gadding; wherefore the end
      must needs be martiall law, to be exercised upon them, as upon theeves,
      robbers, despisers of all lawes, and enimies to the common-wealth and
      welfare of the land. What notable roberies, pilferies, murders, rapes,
      and stealings of yoong children, burning, breaking and disfiguring
      their lims to make them pitifull in the sight of the people, I need
      not to rehearse; but for their idle roging about the countrie, the
      law ordeineth this manner of correction. The roge being apprehended,
      committed to prison, and tried in the next assises (whether they be of
      gaole diliverie or sessions of the peace), if he happen to be convicted
      for a vagabond either by inquest of office, or the testimonie of two
      honest and credible witnesses upon their oths, he is then immediately
      adjudged to be greeviously whipped and burned through the gristle of
      the right eare, with a hot iron of the compasse of an inch about, as a
      manifestation of his wicked life, and due punishment received for the
      same. And this judgment is to be excuted upon him, except some honest
      person woorth five pounds in the queenes books in goods, or twentie
      shillings in lands, or some rich housholder to be allowed by the
      justices will be bound in recognisance to reteine him in his service
      for one whole yeare. If he be taken the second time, and proved to
      have forsaken his said service, he shall then be whipped againe, bored
      likewise through the other eare and set to service; from when if he
      depart before a yeare be expired, and happen afterwards to be attached
      againe, he is condemned to suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span> paines of death as a fellon (except
      before excepted), without benefit of clergy or sanctuarie, as by the
      statute doth appeare. Among roges and idle persons finallie, we find to
      be comprised all proctors that go up and down with conterfeit licenses,
      coosiners, and such as gad about the countrie, using unlawfull games,
      practisers of physiognomie and palmestrie, tellers of fortunes,
      fensers, plaiers, minstrels, jugglers, pedlers, tinkers, pretensed
      scholars, shipmen, prisoners gathering for fees, and others so oft as
      they be taken without sufficient licence. From among which companie our
      bearewards are not excepted and just cause; for I have read that they
      have either voluntarilie, or for want of power to master their savege
      beasts, beene occasion of the death and devoration of manie children in
      sundrie countries by which they have passed, whose parents never knew
      what was become of them.” (Holinshed, vol. i.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The great increase of rogues and vagabonds of all kinds led in the year
    1561 to a proposition for a House of Correction. The plan or scheme of
    which was drawn out at full length, is published in <i>Archæologia</i> (vol.
    xxi. p. 451).</p>

  <p>The House was to be strong and in two divisions: one for the men and
    the other for the women. It was to be built and furnished by the
    alms of the people where it was put up—in this case Westminster was
    proposed. In furnishing, care must be taken that everything should
    be simple, because “it is to be considered beforehand that ye shall
    have to do with the most desperatest people of the earth, geven to all
    spoyle and robbery and soch as will break from you and steale.”</p>

  <p>For work, it must be of a kind that they cannot steal or destroy. A
    Mill, therefore, for the men, or a Lime Kiln; and for the women a Wheel
    for cotton wool or woollen yarn. Of officers there must be six Masters:
    a clerk; a porter and keeper; two beadles, and a miller.</p>

  <p>The rations for the inmates were to be as follows:—To every four
    women, at every meal, one pound of beef, potage, bread and drink. To
    every two men working in the mill, double this allowance. The allowance
    of bread was to be sixteen ounces a day. The allowance of beer was to
    every four women one “pottell” of single beer a day, but to the men
    double that quantity. On fast days an equivalent of butter, cheese,
    herrings, “pescodes,” and such like.</p>

  <p>There were to be two pairs of stocks and shackles for the refractory.
    The Matron was to be a strong woman—the Elizabethan female of the
    baser kind did not weaken her muscles and her nerves with tea; and,
    which is very significant, it is added, “ye must be careful of fyer,
    for the people are desperate and care not what mischief they do.”</p>

  <p>I do not know whether this proposed House of Correction was erected or
    not.</p>

  <p>The present seems the best place and time to speak of systematic
    attempts at Poor Relief.</p>

  <p>The relief of the poor was a duty enjoined on all men. Almsgiving
    was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span> considered especially a virtue becoming to kings and princes.
    Alfred gave alms continually. The Monastic Houses never turned away a
    beggar without a meal to speed him on his way. Rich and noble persons
    kept open house at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. Already the
    custom was commenced of leaving lands or money to the church or to the
    monastery saddled with the condition of alms to be bestowed on the
    anniversary of the donor. By the laws of Ethelred, which probably only
    confirmed a custom, the third part of the tithe due to the Church was
    to be set aside for the use of the poor. In the Canons of Ælfric the
    same proportion is enjoined to be so reserved. And in all the Monastic
    Houses a certain part of the revenues was expended on the Almonry or
    the Infirmary.</p>

  <p>The custom of giving indiscriminately to any vagrant who demanded
    alms, created a class of “masterless” men who would do no work and
    wandered about the country. It took some centuries of this growing evil
    before men could be brought to connect vagrancy with indiscriminate
    almsgiving. At first the efforts made to repress vagrancy were directed
    towards compulsory work. No one dared to maintain, perhaps no one dared
    to think, that it was wrong to give alms to a beggar merely because he
    was a beggar; but every one understood that the labourer must somehow
    be made to work. Had the Clergy and the Monastic Houses perceived the
    truth, vagrancy might have been reduced to a few companies of outlaws
    and marauders. But we cannot blame the clergy of the thirteenth century
    for failing to understand what the clergy of the present century are
    still unable to understand. When the law interfered, the situation was
    wellnigh desperate. The Black Death of 1348–50 had made labour scarce
    and wages high. The necessity of suppressing able-bodied begging and of
    sending the able-bodied beggar back to his native place and his proper
    work was forced upon the Government. The Labour Statutes endeavoured to
    force men to work and to keep down wages. In the fourteenth century,
    just as to-day, there was a natural limit imposed upon wages by the
    price of grain and food. The rustic who understood nothing about this
    limit, naturally desired higher and still higher wages; if he could not
    get this increase in his own parish, he went elsewhere: he begged his
    way; he found food at the monastery; he tasted the joys of food which
    was got without any work for it; he therefore easily dropped into the
    condition of the masterless man and the able-bodied beggar.</p>

  <p>In 1349 the law stepped in. No one must give alms, money, or food to
    the able-bodied, so that for lack of bread they might be compelled
    to work. The rustics, in order to escape the terrors of this law,
    ran about the country from place to place. They pretended to be
    lame, blind, dumb, paralysed; in this disguise they wandered about
    begging with impunity unless they were detected. They pretended (case
    of impostor—Riley) to go on pilgrimage: they joined companies of
    pilgrims, begging by the way, and so got along for a time without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
    working. Therefore in 1388 other laws were framed. Nobody was allowed
    to beg at all without a letter granting him a license; nobody was
    allowed to go on pilgrimage without a license; nobody was to go
    anywhere outside his own part of the country without a license. If any
    were found without such warrant or permission they were clapped into
    the stocks. The Act endeavoured to put a stop not only to able-bodied
    vagrancy, but also to beggars who were crippled or afflicted, for they,
    too, were forbidden to roam.</p>

  <p>The citizens of London were especially severe on masterless men.</p>

  <p>The law, at the same time, recognised the duty of relieving the
    impotent, and the deserving poor, and the right of these to demand
    relief. Wherever they were found they were compelled to go back to the
    place to which they belonged by birth.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be better or more effectual than these laws if they could
    have been enforced. But how were they to be enforced? Where were the
    police who might patrol the roads? How were the villagers disposed
    towards laws which made them accept whatever wages the Lord of the
    Manor chose to give them? In the City of London what were the opinions
    of the working class, of the craftsmen? And how could the Alderman in
    his ward ascertain that every man was following his own craft? No doubt
    the power of arresting, punishing, and sending to their own villages
    the wandering rustic, had the effect of keeping down the number of the
    beggars. In a short time, too, the natural increase of the population
    relieved the scarcity of labour. Moreover the relief of the poor by
    each parish was ordered by the setting aside of a portion of the tithe
    for their benefit (a revival of the Saxon law); and in those cases
    where the tithes went to a monastic house, the same portion should be
    payable by the monks or nuns. The jealousy with which the religious
    Orders were already regarded is shown by the enactment of this
    provision by Richard II. and its confirmation by Henry IV.</p>

  <p>If the laws against grants of the fourteenth century had been enforced
    there would have been an end of the evil. Unfortunately, they could
    not be enforced. In the country there was no kind of Police; in London
    the City had outgrown the old government by Aldermen and Ward, and
    the people were overflowing the City boundaries and were beyond the
    jurisdiction of the Mayor. Now the control of the county would not
    be very effective, say, at Wapping or at Bermondsey, when the people
    began to settle there. During the whole of the fifteenth century the
    demand for able-bodied men for the war in France first, and the Civil
    wars next, was so great that there seem to have been few vagrants
    in the country. Indications, however, are by no means wanting of a
    “masterless” element in London.</p>

  <p>The cessation of the wars threw a large number of men out of
    employment;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span> worse than this, it found them unwilling or unable to
    settle down again to steady work. Other causes also operated to produce
    the same result. The English nobles had ceased to maintain their large
    retinues: no longer did an Earl of Warwick ride into London with seven
    hundred gentlemen and men-at-arms; Sir Thomas More says expressly that
    the men who formerly had been in this kind of service either starved
    or became thieves. Again, the changes in the industrial condition of
    the country threw many people out of work: lands formerly arable were
    turned into pasture; sheep runs took the place of cornfields; one
    shepherd was wanted instead of half-a-dozen labourers. There was again
    a great rise in prices, owing to the influx of silver. In fifty years
    provisions of all kinds were doubled in price while wages rose only
    thirty per cent. Add to these causes the continuance of indiscriminate
    almsgiving.</p>

  <p>The evil grew continually during the whole of the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>Early in the sixteenth century the City of London began to pass
    regulations against vagrants. They forbade able-bodied vagrants
    to beg and citizens to give money to unlicensed beggars: in other
    words, they revived and enforced the old laws. Great strictness was
    ordered. Vagrants had the letter V fastened on their breasts, and
    were driven through Cheapside to the music of a basin ringing before
    them. Four surveyors were appointed to carry out these instructions.
    There was also an officer appointed, called “Master and Chief Avoyder
    and Keeper out of this City and the liberties of the same all the
    mighty vagabonds and beggars and all other suspected persons, except
    such as wear upon them the badge of the City.” The vagrants, when
    apprehended, were whipped at the cart’s tail; they also had to wear
    collars of iron about their necks. Those who were allowed to beg had
    tokens of tin given to them by the Aldermen. As for the relief of
    the deserving poor, there were the “Companies’ stores,” granaries of
    wheat provided for emergencies; alms were asked for every Sunday at
    the church doors; the old hospitals were suppressed at the Reformation
    until St. Bartholomew’s and St. Mary of Bethlehem were granted to the
    City by Henry VIII. and reopened as hospitals. The City did not show
    to advantage in giving money to the poor; we must remember that for
    many centuries charity had been understood as indiscriminate alms given
    by the Church and by rich men. What private persons gave was for the
    advantage of their souls. Latimer and Lever thundered in vain. Latimer
    says:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Now what shall we say of these rich citizens of London? What shall
      I say of them? Shall I call them proud men of London, malicious
      men of London, merciless men of London? No, no, I may not say
      so; they will be offended with me then. Yet must I speak. For is
      there not reigning in London as much pride, as much covetousness,
      as much cruelty, as much oppression and as much superstition as
      was in Nebo? Yes I think, and much more too.... But London was
      never so ill as it is now. In times past men were full of pity and
      compassion, but now there is no pity; for in London their brother
      shall die in the streets for cold, he shall lie sick at the door
      between stock and stock ... and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> perish there for hunger: was there
      ever more unmercifulness in Nebo? I think not. In times past,
      when any rich man died in London they were wont to help the poor
      scholars of the Universities with exhibitions. When any man died,
      they would bequeath great sums of money towards the relief of the
      poor. When I was a scholar in Cambridge myself I heard very good
      report of London, and knew many that had relief of the rich men of
      London; but now I can hear no such good report, and yet I inquire
      of it, and hearken for it; but now charity is waxen cold, none
      helpeth the scholar, nor yet the poor.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lever said:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Nowe speakynge in the behalfe of these vile beggars, ... I wyl
      tell the(e) that art a noble man, a worshipful man, an honest
      welthye man, especially if thou be Maire, Sherif, Alderman, baily,
      constable or any such officer, it is to thy great shame afore the
      worlde, and to thy utter damnation afore God, to se these begging
      as thei use to do in the streates. For there is never a one of
      these but he lacketh eyther thy charitable almes to relieve his
      neede, or els thy due correction to punysh his faute.... These sely
      sols have been neglected throughout al England and especially in
      London and Westminster: But now I trust that a good overseer, a
      godly Byshop I meane, wyl see that they in these two cyties shall
      have their neede releeved, and their faultes corrected, to the good
      ensample of al other tounes and cities.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then St. Thomas’s Hospital and Bridewell were obtained from the King.
    The latter was designed as a House of Instruction and Correction. It
    was to receive the child “unapt for learning”; the “sore and sick when
    they be cured”; and persons who have lost their character and either
    cannot work or cannot find any who will employ them. The children were
    to be made to work; the others were to be taught certain trades. They
    were to be such as would not interfere with the crafts carried on in
    the City.</p>

  <p>The treatment of the poor began by being the work of the towns, each
    town working out its own experimental methods. This was followed by
    legislation in Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Act of 1573, of which we have read Harrison’s account, enjoined
    boring through the ear and whipping, and at the third offence death.
    The Middlesex Sessions Rolls show that these sentences were actually
    carried out. Between 6th October and 14th December 1591, 71 vagrants
    were sentenced at the Sessions to be branded and whipped.</p>

  <p>Who were vagrants? They were defined as proctors or procurators;
    persons pretending to knowledge in “Phisnomye, Palmestrye, and other
    abused Scyences,” masterless men; “fencers, bearewardes, players,
    minstrels,”—not belonging to some noble lord; jugglers, pedlars,
    tinkers, chapmen; labourers refusing customary wages; counterfeiters
    of passes; scholars of Oxford and Cambridge who beg without license;
    sailors not licensed; discharged prisoners without license; impotent
    poor. But of these, players, bearwards, and pedlars were allowed to
    carry on their calling subject to license.</p>

  <p>In every parish the Justices of the Peace were to make a register of
    the names of the poor. Every month they were to search for strange poor.</p>

  <p>Justices in the country and Mayors in London were to assess and tax
    the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> for the relief of the poor; and those who refused to pay
    were to be imprisoned. Three years later it was ordered that “stock”
    of wool, flax, hemp, iron, or other stuff, should be provided for the
    work of the poor. Between 1575 and 1597 other statutes were passed for
    the prevention of increased settlement of poor families. No more houses
    to be built within three miles of London westward except for people
    assessed at £5 in goods or £3 in land. No tenement houses to be built,
    and no inmates to be received.</p>

  <p>In 1597 there was great discussion in the House of Commons on the
    whole subject of poor relief. Finally an Act was passed by which the
    relief of the poor was placed in the hands of church-wardens and four
    overseers of Poor elected every Easter. They had to teach children and
    bind them apprentice; they provided work for the adult; they relieved
    the impotent; they built hospitals; they levied rates; they made Houses
    of Correction; they resorted to more whipping and to banishment, with
    death for return.</p>

  <p>Next there is the interference of the Privy Council ordering the
    Justices of the Peace to look after the vagrants and to report. Here is
    a brief summary.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>1573. Mayor has received a second letter from the Privy Council on
      subject of vagrants.</p>

    <p>1579. Common Council considered the work of the poor at Bridewell
      and referred to Lords of the Council.</p>

    <p>1583. Privy Council recommenced prevention of Irish beggars.</p>

    <p>1594. City meets Justices of Middlesex on subject.</p>

    <p><i>London</i>—1572. Mayor issued precept to Aldermen to inquire
      about poor of every parish. Another precept to use the
      church-wardens—thus to assess the whole ward—to make them pay
      who had given nothing, and to make them pay more who had given too
      little.</p>

    <p>In 1573. Assessments proving too little, collections were made in
      churches.</p>

    <p>1576. Each parish was to elect a surveyor who every night for a
      week should help the constable, beadle, and church-wardens in
      visiting the houses and sending away vagrants.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then followed a double method—relief and repression undertaken by the
    parish and municipal authorities together. The vagrants were taken to
    Bridewell, where the sick were picked out and sent to St. Thomas’s and
    St. Bartholomew’s—thence returned to Bridewell—and made to work for
    their diet. The parish looked after the rest of the poor. The children
    were sent to Christ’s Hospital. The impotent were relieved.</p>

  <p>It seems as if so strict a system must have been successful. But it was
    not.</p>

  <p>In 1601 the Act of 1579 was reconsidered and slightly altered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

  <p>1610. An Act for building one or more Houses of Correction in every
    county was brought in.</p>

  <p>The supply of corn for the markets occupied Parliament a great deal
    between 1610 and 1630. There were bad harvests, and general distress.
    The Privy Council tried to prevent scarcity, to find work for the poor,
    and to regulate trade in the interests of the working classes. Against
    times of scarcity of fuel, a coalyard was established in London for the
    poor. Watchmen were provided in time of plague. More almshouses existed
    then than now for the old and impotent.</p>

  <p>It is customary to speak of the time immediately following the
    Reformation as especially hard-hearted and uncharitable. For instance,
    here is a certain passage, one of many, in Stubbes’s <i>Anatomie</i>, which
    is certainly strong evidence of a lack of charity. It is as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“There is a certayne citie in Ailgna (Anglia) called Munidnol
      (Londinum) where as the poore lye in the streetes, upon pallets of
      strawe, and wel if they have that too, or els in the mire and dirt,
      as commonly it is seene, having neither house to put in their heades,
      covering to keepe them from the colde, nor yet to hyde their shame
      withall, nor a pennie to by them sustenaunce, nor any thing els, but
      are suffered to dye in the streetes like dogges or beastes, without any
      mercy or compassion shewed to them at all. And if any be sicke of the
      plague (as they call it) or any other mortall disease, their maisters
      and mistresses are so impudent (having made, it shoulde seeme, a league
      with Sathan, a covenant with hell, and an obligation with the devil,
      never to have to doe with the workes of mercie) as straight way they
      throwe them out of their doores: and so being caried forth, either in
      cartes or otherwise, or laied downe eyther in the streetes, or els
      conveiyed to some olde house in the fields or gardens, where for want
      of due sustentation, they ende their lives most miserably. Truely,
      brother, if I had not seene it, I would scarsly have thought that the
      like Turkishe crueltie had bene used in all the world.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I would again call attention, however, to a point which has already
    been mentioned in these pages. Before the suppression of the Religious
    Houses these places had taken over and held in their own hands the
    whole management of the poor, the sick, and the disabled, save those
    whom the City Companies took under their own care. For centuries,
    therefore, the people had been taught to regard the care of the sick
    and old, and in a great manner the feeding of the poor, as belonging
    especially to the Religious. It is part of the mediæval mind that the
    poor do so belong to the monastic orders and not to the laity. When,
    therefore, the Houses were suppressed, the modern spirit of Charity had
    to be actually created in the hearts of the people. It was then that
    the education in philanthropy began which has been going on ever since.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

  <p>This outburst of Stubbes is a first lesson in brotherly love. Another
    part of the same lesson is his tirade against hard-hearted creditors,
    which is quoted here, because it applies especially to the citizens of
    London, tender and compassionate in some respects, but flinty-hearted
    as regards the poor prisoners who cannot pay their debts:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Believe me, it greeveth me to heare (walking in the streetes)
      the pitifull cryes and miserable complayntes of poore prisoners
      in durance for debte, and like so to continue all their life,
      destitute of libertie, meate, drink (though of the meanest sort),
      and clothing to their backes, lying in filthie straw and lothsome
      dung, worse than anie dogge, voyde of all charitable consolation
      and brotherly comfort in this world, wishing and thirsting after
      deathe to set them at libertie, and loose them from their shackles,
      gives, and iron bandes. Notwithstanding, these merciless tygers
      (the usurers) are grown to such barbarous crueltie that they blush
      not to say ‘tush, he shall eyther pay me the whole, or else lye
      there till his heeles rotte from his buttocks; and, before I will
      release him, I will make dice of his bones.’ But, take heed, thou
      devil (for I dare not call thee Christian), least the Lord say to
      thee, as hee sayd to that wicked servant (who, having great summes
      forgiven him, would not forgive his brother his small debt, but,
      catching him by the throate, sayd Paie that thou owest), Binde him
      handes and feete, and cast him into utter darknesse, where shall
      bee weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The charities of London consisted of Hospitals for the sick,
    almshouses, schools, and doles for the poor. It was customary for great
    men, ecclesiastics, and Religious Houses, to give every day large
    quantities of food to the poor, whereby they were encouraged to remain
    poor. Stow records many instances of this mischievous and promiscuous
    charity. Henry II., for instance, to show his repentance for the death
    of the Archbishop, fed every day 10,000 persons from the first of April
    till the harvest, a time of year when food is dearest and scarcest.</p>

  <p>Let me follow Stow’s list of Foundations in chronological order.</p>

  <p>1. In very ancient times the Hospital of St. James for leprous women.</p>

  <p>2. In 1197 Domus Dei, or St. Mary Spital, outside Billingsgate.</p>

  <p>3. In 1247 the Hospital of St. Mary Bethlehem turned afterwards into a
    lunatic asylum.</p>

  <p>5. 1337 The College of St. Laurence Poultney.</p>

  <p>6. 1358 The Almshouses of Stodies Lane.</p>

  <p>7. 1367 John Lofken’s Hospital at Kingston-on-Thames.</p>

  <p>8. 1384 John Philpot’s Almshouses for 13 poor people.</p>

  <p>9. 1400 Thomas Knoles bequeathed his house as an almshouse.</p>

  <p>10. Whittington’s College (1421), an almshouse for 13 poor men.</p>

  <p>11. John Carpenter, almshouse for 4 poor men.</p>

  <p>12. Robert Chicheley money for a dinner to 2400 poor men and twopence
    each on his “minde day.”</p>

  <p>13. Philip Malpas, numerous benefactions to prisoners, poor folk,
    girls’ marriage portions, etc.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

  <p>14. Richard Rawson, girls’ marriage portions.</p>

  <p>15. Henry Keble, girls’ marriage portions and seven almshouses.</p>

  <p>16. John Colet, St. Paul’s School, 353 poor men’s children.</p>

  <p>17. John Tate enlarged and increased St. Anthony’s House and Almshouses.</p>

  <p>18. George Monox, almshouses for 13 poor people at Walthamstow.</p>

  <p>19. John Milbourne, almshouses for 14 poor people.</p>

  <p>20. John Allen left rents for the use of the poor.</p>

  <p>21. Andrew Judd, almshouses.</p>

  <p>22. Richard Hills, the Merchant Taylors’ School.</p>

  <p>23. Sir Thomas Gresham, almshouses.</p>

  <p>24. Sir Thomas Rowe, almshouses.</p>

  <p>25. Ambrose Nicolas, almshouses.</p>

  <p>26. John Fuller, almshouses.</p>

  <p>27. Dame Agnes Foster, enlargement of Ludgate Hill Prison.</p>

  <p>28. Avice Gibson, almshouses.</p>

  <p>29. Margaret Danne, money to be lent to young men beginning as
    ironmongers.</p>

  <p>30. Dame Mary Ramsay, endowment of Christ’s Hospital.</p>

  <p>The following are later endowments. Thus Sir Thomas White, citizen and
    Merchant Taylor, Mayor, purchased Gloucester Hall at Oxford; he founded
    St. John’s College there; he erected schools at Bristol and Reading;
    to Bristol he gave £2000 for the purchase of lands. This would produce
    £120 a year, which was to be administered by the Mayor of Bristol. He
    gave £800 to be lent to 16 poor Clothiers at £50 apiece as security for
    ten years, and after that the money to pass to other towns, <i>i.e.</i></p>

  <ul>
    <li>1579 Reading</li>
    <li>1580 The Merchant Taylors’ Company</li>
    <li>1581 Gloucester</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="noindent">He gave to the City of Coventry £1400 with which to purchase lands to
    the annual value of £70. Twelve poor men to have 40s. each free alms;
    then four young men were to have loans of £10 for nine years. He did
    the same thing for Northampton, for Leicester, and for Warwick. A
    worthy benefactor, indeed!</p>

  <p>In 1560 Richard Hills gave £500 towards the purchase of a house called
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> Manor of the Rose, where the Merchant Taylors founded their
    school. At the same time William Lambert, Draper, Justice of the Peace
    in Kent, founded an almshouse for the poor in East Greenwich called
    Queen Elizabeth’s Almshouses.</p>

  <p>In 1568 Sir Thomas Rowe gave the City a new burial-ground by Bethlehem
    Hospital; he also endowed a sermon every Whit Monday; gave £100 to be
    lent to eight poor men; and founded an endowment for the support of ten
    poor men, giving them four pounds a year.</p>

  <p>William Lambe was a benefactor to the City in the sixteenth century.
    He was a cloth worker by trade. In the year 1543, on the suppression
    of the Religious Houses, he obtained possession by purchase of the
    smallest of them all, the Chapel or Hermitage standing at the corner
    of the wall at the end of Monkwell Street. It was called St. James’s
    in the Wall, and was endowed by Henry the Third. Lambe repaired or
    rebuilt the Chapel, and placed in the former garden or in the ancient
    buildings certain almshouses for bedesmen. In 1577 he died, leaving
    this foundation and other sums of money to the Clothworkers. The Great
    Fire spared a part of Lambe’s Chapel and Almshouses.</p>

  <p>Lambe also drew together several springs of water near the present
    Foundling Hospital to a head, called after him Lamb’s Conduit, though
    the name is now spelt without the “e.” He then conveyed the water by
    leaden pipes to Snow Hill, where he rebuilt a ruinous conduit and laid
    in the water.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“He also founded a Free Grammar School at <i>Sutton Valens</i>, the Place of
      his Nativity, in <i>Kent</i>, with a master at £20, and an Usher at £10 per
      Ann. and an Alms-house for six poor people, endowed with £10 yearly.
      He gave £10 per Ann. to the Free School at <i>Maidstone</i> in <i>Kent</i>, for
      the Education of needy Men’s Children; three hundred pounds to the poor
      Clothiers in <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Bridgnorth</i> and <i>Ludlow</i> in <i>Shropshire</i>. He
      left to the Clothworkers’ Company his Dwelling-House, a little to the
      South-West of <i>Cripplegate</i>, with Lands and Tenements to the value of
      £30 per Ann. for paying a Minister to read Divine Service on <i>Sundays</i>,
      <i>Wednesdays</i>, and <i>Fridays</i>, every week, in the Chapel adjoining to
      his House, called St. <i>James</i>, in the Wall by <i>Cripplegate</i>; and for
      Clothing twelve Men with a Frize Gown, one Lockram Shirt, and a good
      strong pair of Winter Shoes; and twelve Women with a Frize Gown, a
      Lockram Smock, and a good pair of Winter Shoes, all ready made for
      wearing; to be given to such as are poor and honest, on the first of
      October. He also gave £15 towards the Bells and Chimes of St. Giles’s
      Without <i>Cripplegate</i>; £6:13:4 yearly to the Company of Stationers,
      for the relief of twelve poor People of the Parish of St. <i>Faith</i>,
      under <i>Paul’s</i>, at the rate of 12d. in Money, and 12d. in Bread, to
      each of them, on every Friday through the year; £6 per Ann. and £100
      to purchase Land, for the Relief of Children in <i>Christ’s</i> Hospital;
      £4 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span> St. <i>Thomas’s</i> Hospital in <i>Southwark</i>; besides some other
      Charities to the Prisons, and for portioning poor Maids.” (Maitland,
      vol. i. p. 264.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen that the building of almshouses was the favourite
    method of charitable endowment. Schools were occasionally endowed
    but not so commonly as almshouses. The sight of an old man broken
    down, unable to earn his bread, is one which appeals to the most
    hard-hearted. The necessity of educating the young was less understood,
    for the simple reason that the children of the working class were
    regarded as simply growing machines for labour, just as their fathers
    were regarded as machines in active working order whose opinions or
    wishes were never so much as asked, while any effort on their part
    to express an opinion was put down at once. This view of the working
    classes, which lasted till the middle of the nineteenth century,
    explains a great deal of what we now consider apathy on the part of
    those who should have known better; it explains among other things the
    opposition to reform, and the jealousy and dread of the working class;
    and it explains why so few schools were endowed in comparison with the
    number of almshouses.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> divers kinds of punishment and the laws are set forth by Harrison
    (Holinshed, vol. i.):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The greatest and most greevous punishment used in England, for such
      as offend against the state, is drawing from the prison to the place
      of execution upon an hurdle or sled, where they are hanged till they
      be halfe dead, and then taken downe and quartered alive, after that
      their members and bowels are cut from their bodies and throwne into
      a fire provided neere hand and within their one sight even for the
      same purpose. Sometimes if the trespasse be not the more hainous, they
      are suffered to hang till they be quite dead. And whensoever any of
      the nobilitie are convicted of high treason by their peeres, that is
      to saie, equals (for an inquest of yeomen passeth not upon them, but
      onlie of the lords of the parliament) this maner of their death is
      converted into the losse of their heads onlie, notwithstanding that the
      sentence doo run after the former order. In triall of cases concerning
      treason, fellonie, or anie other greevous crime not confessed, the
      partie accused doth yeeld, if he be a nobleman, to be tried by an
      inquest (as I have said) and his peeres; if a gentleman, by gentlemen;
      and an inferiour by God and by the countrie, to wit the yeomanrie
      (so combat or battle is not greatlie in use) and being condemned of
      fellonie, manslaughter, etc., he is eftsoons hanged by the necke till
      he be dead, and then cut downe and buried. But if he is convicted of
      wilful murder, doone either upon pretended malice, or in anie notable
      robberie, he is either hanged alive in chains neere the place where the
      fact was committed (or else upon compassion taken first strangled with
      a rope) and so continueth till his bonds consume to nothing. We have
      use neither of the wheele nor of the barre, as in other countries, but
      when wilful manslaughter is perpetrated, beside hanging, the offender
      hath his right hand commonlie striken off before or neere unto the
      place where the act was doone, after which he is led forth to the place
      of execution, and there put to death according to the law.” (<i>See</i>

  <p>Felony was involved in various kinds of crime: such as breach of
    prison; disfiguring the person; robbery in disguise; rape; conspiracy
    against the prince;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span> embezzlement of the master’s money; carrying
    horses into Scotland; stealing hawks’ eggs; unnatural offences;
    witchcraft, conjuring, sorcery, and digging up of crosses; prophesying
    upon arms, cognizances, names and badges; casting of slanderous bills;
    poisoning; desertion; clipping of coin; taking goods from dead men;
    highway robbery; stealing of deer; forging documents, etc., these were
    all, with some others, felony.</p>

    <p>“If a woman poison her husband she is burned alive, if the servant kill
      his master he is to be executed for petie treason, he that poisoneth
      a man is to be boiled to death either in water or lead, although the
      partie die not of the practise; in cases of murther all the accessories
      are to suffer paines of death accordingly. Perjury is punished by the
      pillorie burning in the forehead with the letter P, the rewalting<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
      of the trees growing upon the grounds of the offendors and losse of all
      his moveables. Manie trespasses also are punished by the cutting of
      one or both eares from the head of the offendor, as the utterance of
      seditious words against the magistrates, grain makers, petie robbers,
      etc. Roges are burned through the eares, carriers of sheep out of the
      land by the loss of their hands, such as kill by poison are either
      boiled or skalded to death in lead or seething water. Heretikes are
      burned quicke, harlots and their mates by carting, ducking, and dooing
      of open penance in sheets, in churches and market steeds are often
      put to rebuke.... Roges and vagabonds are often stocked and whipped,
      scolds are ducked upon cucking stooles in the water. Such fellons as
      stand mute and speak not at their arraignement are pressed to death
      by huge weights laid upon a boord, that lieth over their brest, and a
      sharpe stone under their backs, and these commonlie hold their peace,
      thereby to save their goods unto their wives and children, which if
      they were condemned should be confiscated to the prince. Theeves that
      are saved by their bookes and cleargie, for the first offense, if they
      have stolen nothing else but oxen, sheepe, monie, or such like, which
      be no open robberies, as by the high waie side or assailing of any
      man’s house in the night, without putting him in fear of his life,
      or breaking up of his wals or doores, are burned in the left hand,
      upon the brawne of the thumb with an hot iron, so that if they be
      apprehended againe, that marke bewraieth them to have been arraigned of
      fellonie before, whereby they are sure at that time to have no mercie.
      I doo not read that this custom of saving by the book is used anywhere
      else than in England, neither doo I find (after much diligent enquirie)
      what Saxon prince ordained that law.... Our third annoiers of the
      common-wealth are roges, which doo verie great mischief in all places
      where they doo become. For whereas the rich onlie suffer injurie by
      the first two, these spare neither riche nor poore; but whether it be
      great game or small, all is fish that commeth to net with them, and yet
      I saie that both they and the rest are trussed up apace. For there is
      not one yeare commonlie, wherein three hundred or four hundred of them
      are not devoured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>and eaten up by the gallowes in one place and other.
      It appearth by Cardane (who writeth it upon the report of the bishop
      of Lexouia) in the geniture of King Edward the sixt, how Henrie the
      eight, executing his laws verie severelie against such idle persons, I
      meane great theeves, pettie theeves and roges, did hang up threescore
      and twelve thousand of them in his time. He seemed for a while greatlie
      to have terrified the rest; but since his death the number of them is
      so increased, yea although we have had no warres, which are a great
      occasion of their breed (for it is the custom of the more idel sort,
      having but once served or seen the other side of the sea under colour
      of service to shake hand with labour, for ever, thinking it a disgrace
      for himself to return unto his former trade) that except some better
      order be taken, or the lawes be better made to be executed, such as
      dwell in uplandish towns and little villages shall live but in small
      safety and rest. For the better apprehension also of theeves and
      mankillers, there is an old law in England very well provided, whereby
      it is ordered, that if he that is robbed, or any man complaine and give
      warning of slaughter or murder committed, the constable of the village
      whereunto he cometh and crieth for succour, is to raise the parish
      about him, and to search woods, groves, and all suspected houses and
      places, where the trespasser may be, or is supposed to lurke; and not
      finding him there, he is to give warning unto the next constable, and
      so one constable after serch made to advertise another from parish to
      parish, till they come to the same where the offender is harbored and
      found. It is also provided, that if anie parish in this business doo
      not his dutie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> but suffereth the theefe (for the avoiding of trouble
      sake) in carrieng him to the gaile, if he should be apprehended, or
      other letting of their worke, to escape the same parish, is not onlie
      to make fine to the king, but also the same with the whole hundred
      wherein it standeth, to repaie the partie robbed his damages, and leave
      his estate harmlesse. Certes this is a good law, howbeit I have knowne
      by mine owne experience, fellons being taken to have escaped out of the
      stocks, being rescued by other for want of watch and ward, that theeves
      have been let passe, bicause the covetous and greedie parishoners would
      neither take the paines, nor be at the charge to carrie them to prison,
      if it were far off, that when hue and crie have beene made even to the
      faces of some constables, they have said: ‘God restore your losse, I
      have other business at this time!’ And by such meanes the meaning of
      manie a good law is left unexecuted, malefactors imboldened, and manie
      a poore man turned out of that which he hath swet and taken great
      paines for, toward the maintenance of himself and his poore children
      and familie.” (Holinshed, vol. i.)</p>

  <p>Among the punishments mentioned above was that of boiling alive.
    One unfortunate, named Rose, a cook in the house of the Bishop of
    Rochester, poisoned eighteen persons, of whom two died. He seems
    to have done this wilfully. He was boiled to death. This fearful
    punishment was inflicted by lowering the criminal slowly, inch by inch,
    affixed to a post into a deep caldron full of boiling water. How long
    the torture lasted before the heart stopped is not recorded.</p>

  <p>The penalty for bloodshed in the King’s Court was the loss of the right
    hand. The ceremony observed for such a punishment made a ritual of a
    remarkable and imposing ceremony.</p>

  <p>The offender, to quote Pike (<i>History of Crime</i>, vol. ii. p. 83), “was
    brought in by the Marshal, and every stage of the proceedings was under
    the direction of some member of the royal household. The first whose
    services were required was the Serjeant of the Woodyard, who brought
    in a block and cords, and bound the condemned hand in a convenient
    position. The Master Cook was there with a dressing knife, which he
    handed to the Serjeant of the Larder, who adjusted it, and held it
    ‘till the execution was done.’ The Serjeant of the Poultry was close
    by with a cock, which was to have its head cut off on the block by the
    knife used for the amputation of the hand, and the body of which was
    afterwards to be used to ‘wrap about the stump.’ The Yeoman of the
    Scullery stood near, watching a fire of coals, and the Serjeant Farrier
    at his elbow to deliver the searing-irons to the surgeon. The chief
    Surgeon seared the stump, and the Groom of the Salcery held vinegar
    and cold water, to be used, perhaps, if the patient should faint. The
    Serjeant of the Ewry and the Yeoman of the Chandry attended with basin,
    cloths, and towels for the surgeon’s use. After the hand had been
    struck off and the stump seared, the Serjeant of the Pantry offered
    bread, and the Serjeant of the Cellar offered a pot of red wine, of
    which the sufferer was to partake with what appetite he might.”</p>

  <p>Pickpockets, still called cutpurses, abounded. They formed a distinct
    profession; there was even a school for them. This educational
    establishment was carried on by a certain man named Wotton, at a house
    near Billingsgate, in the year 1585. Purses were worn at the girdle,
    attached by a chain or by a leathern string, and the pickpocket could
    be known by the horn thimble worn on the right thumb to protect it from
    the knife with which he cut the purse. Maitland says (p. 269):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Amongest our travells this one matter tumbled owt by the waye,
      that one Wotton, a gentilman borne, kepte an Alehowse att Smarts
      Keye neere Byllingsgate, and reared upp a newe trade of lyffe,
      and in the same howse he procured all the Cuttpurses abowt this
      Cittie to repair to his said howse. There was a Schole Howse sett
      upp to learne younge boyes to cutt purses. There were hunge up two
      devices, the one was a pockett, the other was a purse. The pocket
      had in yt certen cownters, and was hunge abowte with hawkes bells,
      and over the toppe did hannge a little sacringe bell; the purse
      had silver in it; and he that could take owt a cownter without any
      noyse was allowed to be a publique ffoyster, and he that could take
      a peece of sylver owt of the purse without the noyse of any of the
      bells, he was adjudged a judiciall Nypper. Note that a ffoyster is
      a Pickpocte and a Nypper is termed a Pickepurse or a Cutpurse.”</p>

  <p>Among the many additions to Literature made during the Elizabethan age
    we have as detailed a description of the rogues, vagabonds, and the
    criminal class in London as we can desire. Their tricks and cheats;
    their way of living; their language or slang, can all be read in books
    of the time. Harrison, already quoted, furnishes a great deal; more
    may be read in Awdeley, Harman and Rowlands, Dekker, etc. To spare the
    curious reader a great deal of trouble, he is referred to Furnivall’s
    <i>Rogues and Vagabonds of Shakspere’s Youth</i>.</p>

  <p>Harman’s account of these cheats and rogues is full of entertaining
    anecdotes. For instance, there is the story of the robbery of his
    cauldron by the “Upryght men,” and how he recovered it:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I lately had standinge in my well house, which standeth on the
      backeside of my house, a great cawdron of copper, beinge then full
      of water, havinge in the same halfe a doson of pewter dishes, well
      marked, and stamped with the connizance of my armes, whiche being
      well noted when they were taken out, were set aside, the water
      powred out, and my caudren taken awaye, being of such bygnes that
      one man, unlesse he were of great strength, was not able far to
      cary the same. Notwithstandynge, the same was one night within
      this two yeares convayed more than half a myle from my house into
      a commen or heth, and ther bestowed in a great firbushe. I then
      immediatly the next day sent one of my men to London, and there
      gave warning in Sothwarke, kent strete, and Barmesey streete, to
      all the Tynckars there dwelling. That if any such Caudron came
      thether to be sold, the bringar therof should be stayed, and
      promised twenty shyllings for a reward. I gave also intelligence
      to the water men that kept the ferres, that no such vessel should
      be ether convayed to London or into essex, promysing the like
      reward, to have understanding therof. This my doing was well
      understand in many places about, and that the feare of espyinge
      so troubled the conscience of the stealer, that my caudoren laye
      untouched in the thicke firbushe more than halfe a yeare after,
      which, by a great chaunce, was found by hunters for conneys; for
      one chaunced to runne into the same bushe where my caudren was,
      and being perceaved, one thrust his staffe into the same bushe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
      and hyt my caudren a great blowe, the sound whereof dyd cause the
      man to thinke and hope that there was some great treasure hidden,
      wherby he thought to be the better whyle he lyved. And in farther
      searching he found my caudren; so had I the same agayne unloked
      for.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Hooker or Angler was one who by day walked about the streets,
    observing the windows and what was kept in them. At night he carried a
    stick fitted with a hook. He opened the window from the outside, and
    by means of his hook got out what he wanted. Once, says Harman, the
    Hookers dragged from a bed, in which lay asleep a man and two boys, the
    blankets and upper sheets, leaving them in their shirts.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Rogue professed a part and dressed up to it. Harman tells a story
    of two rogues who wanted to break into a house but could not, because
    it was of stone, with the mullions of the windows too close for them to
    creep in. They had, however, a “horse-lock.” They woke up the tenant,
    who had with him only an old woman, and begged for alms. He opened the
    window and held out his hand with a penny in it. They seized his hand:
    he naturally thrust out the other to succour the first; they seized
    that as well, and clasped the two into the horse-lock, so that he was a
    prisoner until he gave up all the money in the house.</p>

  <p>The “wild” Rogue is a variety distinguished by greater courage. Harman
    quotes one as a beggar by inheritance. “His grandfather was a beggar;
    his father was one; and he must needs be one by good reason.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

  <p>The “Prygger of Prauncers” was a horse-stealer; the Pallyard of
    Clapperdogen was one of the counterfeit sick men; he knew how to raise
    blisters, and to create a sore place by means of spearwort or ratsbane.
    The former raises a blister which passes away in a night; the latter a
    sore place that is incurable.</p>

  <p>The Frater—in the name we seem to catch a memory of the extinct
    Friar—carried at his girdle a black box, in which there was a licence
    (forged) to beg.</p>

  <p>The Abram man was one who feigned to have been mad, and to have been
    kept in Bedlam for a term of years.</p>

  <p>The Freshwater Mariner or Whipjack was a beggar who pretended to be a
    sailor on his way to get a ship; or who had recently been shipwrecked;
    or who had been robbed by pirates; and who showed a forged writing
    signed, as it seemed, by men of substance and position confirming his
    story.</p>

  <p>The Counterfeit Crank was a pretended epileptic. He carried a piece
    of white soap, which he put into his mouth to represent the epileptic
    foam. Harman draws a lively picture of such a man. He begged about the
    Temple, his face covered with blood and his rags with mud and dirt. At
    noon he repaired to the back of Clement’s Inn, where in a lane leading
    to the fields he renewed the blood on his face from a bladder which he
    had with him, and daubed his jerkin and hose again with mud. A certain
    printer watched him: in the evening he took a boat across the river;
    the printer followed him and caused him to be taken up in St. George’s
    Fields as a common beggar. They took him to the Constable’s house,
    where they stripped off his rags, showing him to be a healthy and
    comely man with no sign of any disease; in his pockets they found the
    sum of thirteen shillings, three pence, and a halfpenny; they gave him
    an old cloak of the Constable’s, in which he sat by the fire and drank
    three quarts of beer; after which he threw off the cloak and ran away
    naked. But they found out where he lived, viz. in a “pretty house, well
    stuffed, with a fair joined table, and a fair cupboard garnished with
    pewter.” So they took him to Bridewell, where they painted him, first
    in his disguise, and next in his proper attire. Then they whipped him
    through London and brought him back to Bridewell, where he stayed till
    they thought fit to let him go.</p>

  <p>The Dommerar pretended to be dumb: he carried a forged licence, and
    generally pretended to have lost his tongue. One of them was, unluckily
    for himself, caught by a surgeon, who proved that he had a tongue
    though he had neatly folded it away somewhere; and as the fellow still
    would not speak, the surgeon tortured him till he did. This done, they
    haled him before the magistrate, who administered the usual medicine.</p>

  <p>The Drunken Tinker’s career may be dismissed; so may that of the
    Pedlar; the Jackman made false writings and forgeries.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

  <p>The “Demander for Glymmar” was a woman who pretended to have been
    burned out, and carried a begging licence.</p>

  <p>The Basket women carried laces, pins, needles and girdles for sale.
    They bought coney skins and they stole linen from the hedges.</p>

  <p>The “Autem Morte” and the “Walking Morte” were also pedlars, and of
    evil repute.</p>

  <p>The Doxy was the companion and the confederate of the Upright Man.</p>

  <p>The Dell, the Kynchen Morte, and the Kynchen Cove were boys and girls
    in training for the life of the vagabond.</p>

  <p>Queen Elizabeth was fond of driving into the country as well as going
    upon the river. One summer evening she rode out from Aldersgate, along
    the road now called Goswell Road, towards the village of Iseldon or
    Islington. Just outside the town she was surrounded and beset by a
    number of beggars, to her great annoyance. Wherefore she sent her
    running footman, Stone, to the Mayor and to the Recorder complaining
    of this nuisance. The Recorder sent out warrants that same night to
    the quarters complained of, and into Westminster, with the result that
    seventy-four beggars were apprehended and sent to Bridewell, where they
    were “punished” (<i>i.e.</i> soundly flogged). Some of them were found to be
    very rich and usurers.</p>

  <p>The mob under Elizabeth did not venture in assemblies on acts of
    violence. One or two exceptions must be made. Once an armed company,
    headed by gentlemen, attacked Bridewell. Seeing that their object was
    the release of certain unrepentant women whose profession concerned
    the gentlemen only, it is probable that the whole of the rioters were
    gentlemen. On another occasion the ’prentices rose against foreigners.
    Instances of hatred between Spanish residents and citizens of London
    are common in the pages of Machyn. Thus on October 15, 1554, a Spaniard
    killed a servant of Sir George Gifford without Temple Bar. The cause
    of the quarrel is not stated. Ten days afterwards the unfortunate
    foreigner was hanged at Charing Cross. On the 4th of November following
    there was a great fray at Charing Cross between Spaniards and English.
    Not many were hurt, and those who began it were arrested, especially
    a blackamoor. In January another Englishman was murdered by three
    Spaniards, two of whom held him while the other ran him through. In
    April was hanged a certain person, servant to a poulterer. He robbed a
    Spaniard in Westminster Abbey, and for the offence was condemned to be
    hanged for three days, and then to be buried under the gallows. He was
    hanged in a gown of tawny frieze, and a doublet of tawny taffeta, with
    hose lined with sarcenet. Before being turned off he railed at the Pope
    and the Mass.</p>

  <p>Of street violence there was still a great deal, but not so much as
    formerly. The following letter speaks for itself.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On Thursday laste (Feb. 13th 1587) as my Lorde Rytche was rydynge
      in the streates, there was one Wyndam that stode in a dore, and

  <p>The cucking-stool, trebucket, or tumbril, for the ducking of a scold,
    was commonly found in every village. There were several kinds of it.
    One was a chair set at the end of a braser which acted on a see-saw
    principle; one a stump put into the ground at the edge of the water.
    Another was a “standard” fixed at the entrance of a pond. To this
    was attached a long pole, at the extremity of which was fastened the
    chair. Such an one stood almost within the memory of man at the great
    reservoir in the Green Park. Another kind was a sort of cart on four
    wheels, with a braser, at the end of which was the chair. All over
    Oxford these things are found, also at Wootton Bassett, Broad Water
    Worthing, Leominster, Marlborough, Newbury, Scarborough, Warwick,
    Ipswich. In 1777 a woman was ducked at Whitchurch.</p>

  <p>The trial of Ben Jonson, an account of which has been recovered by Mr.
    John Cordy Jeafferson for the Middlesex County Record Society, began
    with the inquest on the body of one James Feake, held in Holywell
    Street, St. Leonard’s Shoreditch, in the thirty-ninth year of Queen
    Elizabeth, and on the 10th day of December. The said James Feake was
    killed in a brawl by one Gabriel Spencer, who struck him with his
    sword in its scabbard in the right eye, so that he fell down, and
    after languishing for three days, died of the wound. What was done to
    Gabriel Spencer does not appear. Perhaps the case was treated as one of
    self-defence. However, Gabriel Spencer presently met with his reward.
    For in the month of September following, viz. in 1598, the said Gabriel
    fell to quarrelling with a young man named Ben Jonson, in Shoreditch,
    or Hoxton Fields; from words they quickly came to blows, and Gabriel
    was pierced by Ben Jonson’s sword through the right side, so that he
    died immediately. Jonson was thrown into prison and was tried for
    manslaughter, not for murder. He pleaded guilty; he also pleaded his
    clergy, read his “neck-verse,” and was released in accordance with the
    statute 18 Eliz. c. 7, after being branded in the hand with what the
    London people called the Tyburn T.</p>

  <p>I have found one instance, the earliest, of a kind of transportation.
    Among Frobisher’s Company were six men condemned to death. Their
    sentence was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> commuted into banishment. They were sent on board
    Frobisher’s ship, to be landed on the shores of “Freezeland,” that
    is Greenland or Labrador, with weapons and provisions. They were
    instructed to win the good-will and friendship of the natives and to
    inquire into their “estate.” In other words, to find out all that could
    be learned concerning them. It is unfortunate that history makes no
    further mention of these pioneers.</p>

  <p>The story of Thomas Appletree: his terrible accident; his deadly peril;
    his repentance; and his pardon, is pathetic. I suffer Stow to tell it
    in his own words:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The seventeenth day of July, the Queenes moste excellent Maiestie,
      being in ye river of Thamis, betwixt hir Highnesse Mannour of
      Greenewiche and Detteforde, in hur privie Barge, accompanyed with
      Monsier Schemere the French Embassadour, the Earle of Lincolne, and
      Maister Vizchamberlaine, etc., with whim she entred discourse about
      waightie affaires; it chanced that one Thomas Appletree, a yong man
      and servant to Maister Henrie Carie, with two or three children of hir
      Maiesties Chappell, and one other named Barnard Acton, being in a Boate
      on the Thamis, rowing up and downe betwixte the places above named,
      the foresaide Thomas Appletree hadde a Caliver or Harquebuze, whych he
      hadde three or foure times discharged with Bullet, shooting at randone
      very rashly, who by greate misfortune shot one of the Watermen, being
      the seconde man nexte unto the Bales of the saide Barge, labouring
      with hys Oare (whyche sate wythin five feete of hir Highnesse), cleane
      through bothe hys armes; the blowe was so greate and greevous, that it
      moved him out of his place, and forced hym to crye and scritche oute
      piteouslye, supposing hymselfe to be slain, and saying, he was shot
      through the body. The man bleeding abundantly, as though he had had 100
      Daggers thrust into hym, the Queenes Maiestie showed such noble courage
      as is moste wonderfull to be heard and spoken of, for beholding hym so
      maimed, and bleding in such force, she never bashed thereat, but shewed
      effectually a prudent and magnanimous heart, and moste courteously
      comforting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span> the pore man, she bad hym be of good cheere, and saide hee
      should want nothing that might bee for his ease, commaunding hym to
      be covered till such time as hee came to the shoare, till which time
      hee lay bathing in his owne bloud, which might have been an occasion
      to have terrified the eyes of the beholders. But such and so great
      was the courage and magnanimitie of our dread and soveraigne Ladie,
      that it never quailed. To be short, Thomas Appletree and the rest were
      apprehended and brought before her honorable Counsell, who with great
      gravitie and wisedome employed their times verie carefully, and with
      greate diligence examined the saide Appletree and his companions,
      and finding the case moste hainous and wicked, justly pronounced
      againste him the sentence of death, and commit him to the Marshalsea in
      Southwarke, from whence ye Tuisday following hee was brought through
      the Citie with the Knight Marshalles men, ledde up to the Tower Hill,
      and so to Radcliffe upp to Blackwall, and so downe to the waterside,
      where was a Gibet sett upp, directly placed betwixte Detforde and
      Greenewiche, for the execution of this malefactour, who in deed verie
      pitifully bewayled the offence hee had committed, and as well in prison
      as by the waie prepared himselfe verie penitently and willingly to
      offer his body to the death.</p>

    <p>Thus verie godly hee purposed to finish his miserable and wretched
      life, and so prepared himselfe to ascend and goe upp the Ladder, and
      being on the same, he turned himselfe, and spake to the people as
      followeth: Good people, I am come hither to die, but God is my Judge, I
      never in my life intended hurt to the Queenes Most excellent Maiestie,
      nor meant the harme of any creature, but I pray to God with all my
      heart long to prosper and keepe her Highnes in health, who blesse and
      defende her from all perilles and daungers, who prosper her in all her
      affaires, and blesse her moste Honorable Counsell, giving them grace to
      doe all things to the glorie of God, and the benefit of this realme;
      but of all things I am moste sorie for my offence, and wofully bewaile
      the same; and more, I am penitent and sorie for my good Maister,
      Maister Henrie Carie, who hath been so grieved for my fault, suffering
      rebuke for the same: I would to God I had never been borne that have
      so grievously offended him. And with that the teares gusht oute of
      his eyes verie faste. This saide, hee persuaded all men to serve God,
      and to take an example by him, and every night and morning moved them
      devoutly to say the Lord’s Prayer. And as the executioner had put the
      rope about his necke, the people cried stay, stay, stay, and with that
      came the right Honorable sir Christopher Hatton, Vizchamberlaine to
      her highnes, who enquired what hee had confessed, and being certified,
      as is before expressed, hee bailed his bonet, and declared, that the
      Queenes Maiestie had sent him thither both to make the cause open to
      them how hainous and greevous the offence of ye said Thomas Appletree
      was, and further to signify to him her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span> gracious pleasure; and so
      continued his message, as ye may reade it printed by itself, and
      annexed to this discourse. Which, when he had declared, the hangman
      was commanded to take the roape from his necke. Appletree being come
      downe from the Ladder, received his pardon, and gave God and the Prince
      praise for so great a benefite as he had by her moste gracious bountie
      received. This done, Maister Vizchamberlaine saide: Good people pray
      for the Queenes Maiestie, and then was this prayer saide, which is
      usually reade (for the preservation of her Maiestie) in the Church: O
      Almighty and everlasting God, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,
      which dost fro’ thy throne behold all the dwellers of the earth, most
      heartily we beseech thee with thy favour to behold our moste gracious
      soveraigne lady Queen Elizabeth, etc. Whereunto all the people joyfully
      accorded to saye Amen, crying, God save the Queen: casting up their
      Cappes.” (Stow’s <i>Chronicles of England</i>.)</p>

  <p>One of the last cases of ordeal by battle belongs to the year 1571.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The eighteenth of June, in Trinitie terme, there was a combat
      appointed to have been fought for a certeine manour and demaine
      lands belonging thereunto in the Ile of Hartie, adjoining to the Ile
      of Shepie in Kent. Simon Low and John Kime were plaintifs, and had
      brought a writ of right against Thomas Paramore, who offered to defend
      his right by battell. Whereupon the plaintiffs aforesaid accepted to
      answer his challenge, offering likewise to defend their right to the
      same manour and lands, and to prove by battell, that Paramore had no
      right nor good title to have the same manour and lands. Hereupon the
      said Thomas Paramore brought before the judges of the common plees of
      Westminster, one George Thorne, a big, broad, strong set fellow; and
      the plaintifs Henrie Nailer, maister of defense, and servant to the
      right honourable the earle of Leicester, a proper slender man, and not
      so tall as the other. Thorne cast downe a gantlet, which Nailer tooke
      up, upon the sundaie before the battell should be tried. On the next
      morow, the matter was staied, and the parties agreed, that Paramore
      being in possession should have the land, and was bound in five hundred
      pounds to consider the plaintifs, as upon hearing the matter the judges
      should award. The queens majestie abhorring bloodshed, and (as the poet
      very well saith)</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">was the taker up of the matter, in this wise. It was thought good,
      that for Paramore’s assurance, the order should be kept touching
      the combat, and that the plaintifs Low and Kime should make default
      of appearance; but that yet such as were sureties for Nailer their
      champions appearance, should bring him in; and likewise those that were
      sureties for Thorne, should bring in the same Thorne, in discharge of
      their band; and that the court should sit in Tuthill Fields where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span> was
      prepared one plot of ground of one and twentie yards square, double
      railed for the combat. Without the west square a stage being set up for
      the judges, representing the court of the common plees.</p>

    <p>All the compasse without the lists was set with scaffolds one above
      another, for people to stand and behold. There were behind the square
      where the judges sat, two tents, the one for Nailer, the other for
      Thorne. Thorne was there in the morning timelie, Nailer about seven
      of the clock came through London, apparelled in a doublet, and gallie
      gascoine breeches all of crimsin satin, cut and rased, a hat of blacke
      velvet, with a red feather and band, before him drums and fifes
      plaieng. The gantlet cast downe by George Thorne was borne before
      the said Nailer upon a sword’s point, and his baston (a staffe of an
      ell long, made taper wise, tipt with horne) with his shield of hard
      leather was borne after him, as Askam a yeoman of the queenes gard.
      He came into the place at Westminster and staieng not long before the
      hall door, came back into the king’s street, and so along thorough the
      Sanctuarie and Tuthill street into the field, where he staied till past
      nine of the clocke, and then Sir Jerome Bowes brought him to his tent:
      Thorne being in the tent with Sir Henrie Cheinie long before.</p>

    <p>About ten of the clocke, the court of common plees remooved, and came
      to the place prepared. When the Lord chief Justice, with two other his
      associates were set, then Low was called solemnlie to come in, or else
      to lose his writ of right. Then after a certeine time, the suerties of
      Henrie Nailer were called to bring in the said Nailer, champion for
      Simon Low. And shortlie thereupon, Sir Jerome Bowes, leading Nailer by
      the hand, entred with him the lists, bringing him downe that square by
      which he entred, being on the left hand of the judges, and so about
      till he came to the next square, just against the judges, and there
      making courtesie, first with one leg and then with the other, passed
      foorth till he came to the middle of the place, and then made the like
      obeisance and so passing till they came to the barre, there he made
      the like courtesie, and his shield was held up aloft over his head.
      Nailer put off his netherstocks, and so barefoot and barelegged, save
      his silke scauilones to the ankles, and his dublet sleeves tied up
      above the elbow, and bareheaded, came in, as is aforesaid. Then were
      the suerties of George Thorne called to bring in the same Thorne; and
      immediately Sir Henry Cheinie entering at the upper end on the right
      hand of the judges, used the like order in comming about by his side,
      as Nailer had before on that other side; and so comming to the barre
      with like obeisance, held up his shield. Proclamation was made that
      none should touch the barres, nor presume to come within the same,
      except such as were appointed.</p>

    <p>After all this solemne order was finished, the lord chiefe justice
      rehearsing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> the maner of bringing the writ of right by Simon Low, of
      the answer made thereunto by Paramore, of the proceeding therein, and
      how Paramore had challenged to defend his right to the land by battell,
      by his champion Thomas Thorne, and of the accepting the triall that
      was by Low with his champion Henrie Nailer; and then for default of
      appearance in Low he adjudged the land to Paramore, and dismissed the
      champion, acquiting the suerties of their bands. He also willed Henrie
      Nailer to render againe to George Thorne his gantlet. Whereto the
      said Nailer answered, that his lordship might command him anie thing,
      but willingly he would not render the said gantlet to Thorne except
      he could win it. And further he challenged the said Thorne to play
      with him half a score blowes, to shew some pastime to the lord chiefe
      justice and to the other there assembled. But Thorne answered, that
      he came to fight, and would not plaie. Then the lord chiefe justice
      commending Nailer for his valiant courage, commanded them both quietlie
      to depart the field, etc.” (Stow’s <i>Chronicles of England</i>.)</p>

    “<span class="smcap">Peter Morice</span>, a Dutchman, in 1580 explained before the Lord Mayor
    and Aldermen his invention for raising the Thames water high enough
    to supply the upper parts of the City, and threw a jet of water over
    the steeple of St. Magnus Church. Before this time no such thing had
    been known in England. Whereupon the City granted him a lease for 500
    years of the Thames water, and the places where his mills stood, and
    of one of the arches of old London Bridge, at 10s. yearly. Two years
    afterwards they granted him another arch on the same terms. He received
    large grants from the City to help him to complete this curious system
    of hydraulic mechanism. In the Act for rebuilding the City after the
    Great Fire it was provided that Thomas Morris should have power to
    rebuild with timber his water-house for supplying the City (18 &amp; 19
    Charles II. c. 8). The works continued in the family till 1701, when
    they were sold for £36,000 to Richard Soames, and afterwards became the
    property of a Company. On June 23rd, 1767, the fifth arch was granted
    for the use of the Company. By Act of Parliament, 3 Geo. IV. cap. 109,
    July 26th, 1822, the Acts relating to the Company were repealed. The
    Company were to be paid £10,000, and their works to be removed by, or
    at the expense of, the New River Company.” (<i>Remembrancia.</i>)</p>

      <span class="subhead">THE CHANGES OF RITUAL</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> 28th July 1900 was published in the <i>Athenæum</i> of that date a paper
    by the late Rev. Prebendary Kitto, Vicar of St. Martin’s in the Fields,
    on the changes effected in the rites and ceremonies of that church
    during the years 1537–1560 or thereabouts. This instructive document
    was compiled from the accounts and papers preserved in the archives of
    the church.</p>

  <p>Thus the ritual remained much the same during the reign of Henry
    VIII. as it had been before the commencement of the Reformation. They
    provided, as of old, candles, palms, incense; they hallowed sacred
    coals for Easter Eve; they provided lights for the font, for the rood
    loft, and for the altars; they set up the Easter sepulchre; they used
    the great Paschal Candle, the tabernacle, and the pyx; they maintained
    the side altars, and they not only repaired the vestments but they
    received gifts of new vestments. They had obits and “minds,” celebrated
    mass and kept up the images.</p>

  <p>In 1538 lights before images were forbidden; but a perpetual light was
    maintained at the high altar.</p>

  <p>In 1539 the Parish sold the iron and latten candlesticks which had been
    used for the images.</p>

  <p>In the same year a Bible was bought for the church. It cost 12s. 8d.</p>

  <p>In 1540 Henry is described under the title of “Defender of the Faith
    and Supreme Head, under God, of the Church of England and Ireland.”</p>

  <p>In 1547 they sold all the wax they had in stock, according to the
    injunction.</p>

  <p>In 1548 no more lights were allowed. The Parish sold the rest of their
    candlesticks, and bought a Paraphrase of the Gospel and a Communion
    Cup; they also whitewashed the church, in order, I suppose, to
    obliterate the pictures.</p>

  <p>In 1549 the altars were stripped: there were to be no more flowers or
    garlands, no incense and no lights.</p>

  <p>In 1550 they set up a box for the poor; sold their vestments; bought
    white surplices, and put a green cloth over the “Communion Table.”</p>

  <p>In 1553 they sold the “old broken stuff of the Rood Loft” and made
    “Communion Pews.”</p>

  <p>In the same year they were made to feel the mutability of things
    religious, because everything had to be restored at great expense.
    Their candlesticks, however, were of tin. They bought a cross for
    processions; a mass-book, a holy water stoup with a sprinkle; a basket
    for the holy bread; a pyx and all the other old vessels. Also, because
    under Edward they had written texts on the walls, they were now ordered
    to wipe them all out.</p>

  <p>In 1559 they began to go back again to the Edwardian time, but not
    immediately. In 1560 the Bible was restored.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that the parish officers were a little uncertain,
    after their melancholy experience, of the stability of things. They
    therefore kept the vessels bought in the time of Queen Mary until 1569,
    when, feeling somewhat reassured, they sold them all.</p>

      <span class="subhead">GOLDSMITHS’ ROW</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Opposite</span> to the Cross in Cheapside, on the south side of the street,
    there stood a superb pile of buildings, called Goldsmiths’ Row,
    extending from the west to Bread Street. This Row was erected in 1491,
    by Thomas Wood, Goldsmith, Sheriff of London. Stow describes it in
    1598 as ‘the most beautiful frame of fair houses and shops that be
    within the walls of London, or elsewhere in England. It containeth in
    number ten fair dwelling-houses and fourteen shops, all in one frame,
    uniformly builded four stories high, beautified toward the street
    with the Goldsmith arms and the likeness of Woodmen (in memory of
    the founder’s name) riding on monstrous beasts, all of which is cast
    in lead, richly painted over and gilt.’ ‘This said front was again
    new painted and gilt over in the year 1594, Sir Richard Martin being
    then Mayor, and keeping the Mayoralty in one of them’ (Stow, edition
    1633). ‘At this time the City greatly abounded in riches and splendour,
    such as former ages were unacquainted with. Then it was beautiful
    to behold the glorious appearance of Goldsmiths’ shops in the South
    Row of Cheapside, which, in a continued course, reached from the Old
    Change to Bucklersbury, exclusive of four shops only of other trades
    in all that space’ (Maitland’s <i>History of London</i>, edition 1760,
    vol. i. p. 301). King Charles the First in 1629 issued a Proclamation
    ordering the Goldsmiths to plant themselves, for the use of their
    trade, in Cheapside or Lombard Street. The Lords of the Council, in
    1637, sent a letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen (<i>vide</i> vii. 197),
    ordering them to close every shop in Cheapside and Lombard Street that
    did not carry on the trade of a Goldsmith, about twenty-four in all,
    Grove and one Widow Hill, Stationers; Dover, a Milliner; Brown, a
    Bandseller; Sanders, a Drugster; Medcalfe, a Cook; Edwards, a Girdler,
    etc.—Rushworth’s ‘State Papers.’” (<i>Remembrancia</i>, p. 106, n. 1.)</p>

      <span class="subhead">THE GALLANTS’ WALK IN ST. PAUL’S</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Your</span> mediterranean isle is then the only gallery, wherein the pictures
    of all your true fashionate and complemental Gulls are, and ought to
    be hung up. Into that gallery carry your neat body: but take heed you
    pick out such an hour, when the main shoal of islanders are swimming
    up and down. And first observe your doors of entrance, and your exit:
    not much unlike the players at the theatres: keeping your decorums,
    even in phantasticality. As for example: if you prove to be a northern
    gentleman, I would wish you to pass through the north door, more often
    especially than any of the other: and so, according to your countries
    take note of your entrances.</p>

  <p>Now for your venturing into the walk. Be circumspect, and wary what
    pillar you come in at: and take heed in any case, as you love the
    reputation of your honour, that you avoid the serving-man’s log, and
    approach not within five fathom of that pillar: but bend your course
    directly in the middle line, that the whole body of the church may
    appear to be yours: where, in view of all, you may publish your suit
    in what manner you affect most, either with the slide of your cloak
    from the one shoulder: and then you must, as ’twere in anger, suddenly
    snatch at the middle of the inside, if it be taffeta at the least:
    and so by that means your costly lining is betrayed, or else by the
    pretty advantage of compliment. But one note by the way I do especially
    woo you to, the neglect of which makes many of our gallants cheap and
    ordinary, that by no means you be seen above four turns: but in the
    fifth make yourself away, either in some of the semsters’ shops, the
    new tobacco-office, or amongst the booksellers, where, if you cannot
    read, exercise your smoke, and inquire who has writ against this divine
    weed, etc. For this withdrawing yourself a little will much benefit
    your suit, which else, by too long walking, would be stale to the whole
    spectators: but howsoever if Paul’s jacks be once up with their elbows,
    and quarrelling to strike eleven: as soon as ever the clock has parted
    them, and ended the fray with his hammer, let not the Duke’s gallery
    contain you any longer, but pass away apace in open view: in which
    departure, if by chance you either encounter, or aloof off throw your
    inquisitive eye upon any knight or squire, being your familiar, salute
    him not by his name of Sir such a one, or so: but call him Ned, or
    Jack, etc. This will set off your estimation with great men: and if,
    though there be a dozen companies between you, ’tis the better, he call
    aloud to you, for that is most genteel, to know where he shall find
    you at two o’clock: tell him at such an ordinary or such: and be sure
    to name those that are dearest, and whither none but gallants resort.
    After dinner you may appear again, having translated yourself out of
    your English cloth cloak into a light Turkey grogram, if you have that
    happiness of shifting: and then be seen, for a turn or two, to correct
    your teeth with some quill or silver instrument, and to cleanse your
    gums with a wrought handkerchief: it skills not whether you dined, or
    no: that is best known to your stomach: or in what place you dined:
    though it were with cheese, of your mother’s own making, in your
    chamber, or study.</p>

  <p>Now if you chance to be a gallant not much crost among citizens: that
    is, a gallant in the mercer’s books, exalted for satins and velvets:
    if you be not so much blest to be crost (as I hold it the greatest
    blessing in the world to be great in no man’s books): your Paul’s walk
    is your only refuge: the Duke’s tomb is a sanctuary: and will keep
    you alive from worms, and land-rats, that long to be feeding on your
    carcass: there you may spend your legs in winter a whole afternoon:
    converse, plot, and talk any thing:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> jest at your creditor, even to his
    face: and in the evening, even by lamp-light, steal out: and so cozen a
    whole covey of abominable catchpolls. Never be seen to mount the steps
    into the quire, but upon a high festival day, to prefer the fashion of
    your doublet: and especially if the singing-boys seem to take note of
    you: for they are able to buzz your praises above their anthems, if
    their voices have not lost their maidenheads: but be sure your silver
    spurs dog your heels, and then the boys will swarm about you like so
    many white butterflies: when you in the open quire shall draw forth a
    perfumed embroidered purse, the glorious sight of which will entice
    many countrymen from their devotion to wondering: and quoit silver into
    the boys’ hands, that it may be heard above the first lesson, although
    it be read in a voice as big as one of the great organs.</p>

  <p>This noble and notable act being performed, you are to vanish presently
    out of the quire, and to appear again in the walk: but in any wise be
    not observed to tread there long alone: for fear you be suspected to be
    a gallant cashiered from the society of captains, and fighters.” (<i>The
      Gull’s Horn Book.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="NOTE_ON_AGASS_MAP_AT_THE_END_OF_THE_VOLUME">NOTE ON AGAS’S MAP AT THE END OF THE VOLUME</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Ralph Agas</span> was born about 1540. He was a land-surveyor, and his
    chief claim to notice lies in the three maps or plans he made of
    London, Oxford, and Cambridge. Of these the one reproduced in this
    volume, entitled “A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster,
    the Borough of Southwark and parts adjacent,” was engraved by Edward
    J. Francis, and edited by W. H. Overall, F.S.A. Mr. Overall made a
    careful examination of all the facts, and believes that the original
    map of Agas was not made earlier than the year 1591, though it has been
    commonly supposed to have been made about 1560. Of the original, two
    copies are extant—one in the Guildhall, and the other in the Pepysian
    Collection at Magdalen College, Oxford.</p>

  <p>In 1737 G. Vertue published a copy of Agas’s map, altering the original
    in many important particulars, which are enumerated by Mr. Overall in
    his account of the map. Among these may be mentioned the water-bearers
    seen off Tower Stairs and the Steelyard, filling their casks, which are
    slung across the backs of horses, by the aid of a long-handled ladle.
    In Vertue’s map this interesting detail is turned into a meaningless
    one, namely, a man driving cows into the water with a whip. In Agas
    the figures seen in the fields are in Elizabethan costume; in Vertue’s
    map they are in the costume of William III.’s reign. Other particulars
    omitted in Vertue are the royal barge in mid-stream off Baynard’s
    Castle; the Martello Tower at the mouth of the Fleet; the Chapter
    House and the Church of St. Gregory on the south side of St. Paul;
    and various other points. By noting these details, Vertue’s spurious
    reproduction can be at once distinguished from the genuine map of
    Agas.</p>

  <p>“<i>The part of the North West Suburbs of London, since called Saint
    Giles’s, was about the time of the Norman Conquest an un-built tract of
    country, or but thinly scattered with habitations.—The parish derived
    its name if not its origin from the ancient Hospital for Lepers, which
    was built on the site of the present church by MATILDA queen of King
    Henry I. and dedicated to Saint Giles: before which time there had only
    been a small Chapel or Oratory on the spot.—It is described in old
    records, as abounding with gardens and dwellings in the flourishing
    times of Saint Giles’s Hospital but declined in population and
    buildings after the suppression of that establishment, and remained
    but an inconsiderable village till the end of the reign of Elizabeth,
    after which period it was rapidly built on, and became distinguished
    for the number and rank of its inhabitants. The great increase of S<sup>t</sup>.
    Giles’s Parish occasioned the separation of S<sup>t</sup>. George’s Bloomsbury
    Parish from it anno 1734.—The above view (which is partly supplied by
    the great Plan of London by Ralph Aggas, and partly from authorities
    furnished by parochial documents) was taken anno 1570.</i>”</p>

    the South about 2 English miles. It is also so plentifully peopled,
    that it is divided into a hundred and 22 Parishes within the Liberties,
    besides 16 Parishes that are in the suburbs. It is planted on a very
    good soyle: for on the one side it is compassed with come &amp; pasture
    ground, on the other side it is inclosed with the river of Thames,
    which not only aboundeth in all kind of fresh water-fish, but also is
    so navigable, that it as well bringeth abundance of commodities from
    all parts of the World, as also conveieth forth such commodities as the
    plentifulnesse of our Contry doth yield us: which both augments the
    fame thereof abroad, and also increaseth the riches thereof at hom; so
    that as it is head and chief City of the whole Realm, so it is likewise

    <p>‘The pen of the ready writer here is fluent; the picture wants nothing
      in completeness. The records of the city and the kingdom have been
      ransacked for facts and documents, and they are here marshalled with
      consummate skill. In surveying the political history of London from
      James I. to Queen Anne, Sir Walter Besant reveals himself as an
      unsparing and impartial historian, and in this respect alone the work
      must command our admiration and our praise. But there is also included
      the most vivid presentation of the story of the Great Plague and
      the Great Fire that has ever been brought between the covers of one
      book.’—<i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

    <p>‘It is impossible to speak too highly of this endeavour to say all
      that is worth saying about London, and to say it in a manner which
      shall at once satisfy the historical student and attract public
      attention.’—<i>Yorkshire Post.</i></p>

    <p>‘Much has hitherto been written, both by way of fact and fiction, as
      well as by a blend of each, to describe London in its grievous trials
      of pestilence and flame; but Sir Walter Besant has here gathered
      together by far the most graphic and the most trustworthy accounts that
      have hitherto been penned.’—<i>The Guardian.</i></p>

    <p>‘The whole work is one of singular interest because the subject is
      treated with the lightness of touch and descriptive power not always
      attained by antiquarian writers.’—<i>The Record.</i></p>

    <p>‘This handsome volume furnishes a fascinating record, both pictorial
      and literary, of seventeenth century London, such as can be found
      nowhere else. To the student it will be invaluable; to the general
      reader with antiquarian interests and a taste for social history, a
      never-failing source of delight.’—<i>The Contemporary Review.</i></p>

    <p>‘There is not a dull page in the book, and the fact that the treatment
      is somewhat discursive makes the volume more delightful. We can give no
      idea of its variety and its charm, but every one who wishes to know the
      London of two hundred and fifty years ago will feel, as he opens this
      volume, that he has stepped back into that world of great events, and
      will live again through its civil discord, its Plague, and Fire, and
      its strange superstitions.’—<i>The London Quarterly Review.</i></p>

    <p>‘Turn where you will in his pages, you get some interesting glimpse
      which opens up the past and illumines the present.’—<i>The Contemporary
        Review.</i></p>

    <p>‘A handsome and very interesting book is the result, for which the
      curious reader and the student will alike be grateful.... Gives an
      admirable impression of the times.’—<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

    <p>‘It is excellently planned and very ably and agreeably executed....
      The chief charm of this work is the pleasantness of the style in which
      it is written—easy, clear, and individual. To the accuracy of the
      ideal historian Sir Walter added the picturesqueness of the popular
      novelist.’—<i>The Globe.</i></p>

    <p>‘It forms a sumptuous volume, and is marked, of course, by minute
      research and enthusiastic interest. Will be a thoroughly engrossing
      study for all those—and they are now many—to whom the past of the
      Empire’s capital is a subject of the keenest fascination.’—<i>St.
        James’s Gazette.</i></p>

    <p>‘To praise this book were superfluous. Sir Walter was ideally suited
      for the task which he set himself. He was an antiquarian, but not
      a Dryasdust; he had the topographical sense, but he spares us
      measurements; he was pleasantly discursive; if he moralised he was
      never tedious; he had the novelist’s eye for the romantic. Above all,
      he loved and reverenced London. Though only a Londoner by adoption,
      he bestowed upon the capital a more than filial regard. Besant is
      the nineteenth century Stow, and something more.... This remarkable
      volume.... It is a monument of faithful and careful research.’—<i>The
        Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

    <p>‘Will be of the utmost value to every student of the life and history
      of London.’—<i>The Standard.</i></p>

    <p>‘Altogether this posthumous work of the historian of London is one
      of the most fascinating books which he ever wrote.’—<i>The Municipal
        Journal.</i></p>

    <p>‘It is a wonderfully complete history.... Will probably stand to
      all time as the brightest and most authoritative book on a period
      which is bound, by its very evils, to have a fascination for the
      student of customs and manners, and for the student of national
      development.’—<i>The Liverpool Post.</i></p>

    <p>‘The book is engrossing and its manner delightful.’—<i>The Times.</i></p>

    <p>‘A work of great value and interest; ... profoundly interesting.’—<i>The
        Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

    <p>‘Of facts and figures such as these this valuable book will be found
      full to overflowing, and it is calculated, therefore, to interest all
      kinds of readers, from the student to the dilettante, from the romancer
      in search of matter to the most voracious student of “Tit-Bits.”’—<i>The
        Athenæum.</i></p>

    <p>‘Stimulating, edifying, interesting, horrifying, in turns, the book has
      not a dull moment.... As it is the best, it will surely prove the most
      prized and popular of modern books on London.’—<i>Notes and Queries.</i></p>

    <p>‘The work is copiously illustrated with reproductions of old prints,
      and is altogether a delightful and fascinating guide to the Metropolis
      at an eventful period of its history.’—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

    <p>‘Of the present lordly quarto volume it may be said that it fairly
      represents that “Survey” which Sir Walter Besant conceived, and which
      he used to refer to as his <i>magnum opus</i>. It is a worthy literary
      monument to his deep knowledge and love of London.’—<i>The Academy.</i></p>

    <p>‘Besant’s interesting and valuable book.’—<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

    <p>‘It is assuredly a delightful book to lose oneself in, and so to
      think one’s way back into a simpler and perhaps, after all, a merrier
      England.’—<i>The Bookman.</i></p>

    <p>‘A book to be treasured and studied.... The work as a whole is a
      notable achievement, and will stand as the classical authority on
      eighteenth century London.’—<i>The Speaker.</i></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
